<p class="chaptitle">A RED-HOT STOVE AND DESTINY.</p>


<p>"Isn't it a dandy picture&mdash;the real thing&mdash;just
as I've always imagined it. Herc!"</p>

<p>Ned Strong wheeled from the gaudily colored
lithograph he had been admiring, and turned to
a red-headed youth of about his own age&mdash;almost
eighteen&mdash;who stood beside him in the postoffice
and general store at Lambs' Corners, a remote
village in the Catskill mountains.</p>

<p>"It's purty as a yearling colt," responded the
lad addressed, examining once more, with an important
air of criticism, the poster in question.
The lithograph had been tacked up only the day
before, but by this time half the boys in the neighboring
country had examined it.</p>

<p>The poster represented a stalwart, barefooted
jackie, in Uncle Sam's natty uniform, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
on the flying-bridge of a battleship and "wig-wagging"
the commanding officer's messages.
The bright-red signal flag, with its white center,
which he wielded, made a vivid splash of color.
In the background a graphically depicted sea,
flecked with "whitecaps," was pictured. As a
whole, the design was one well calculated to
catch the attention of all wholesome, adventurous
lads, particularly two, who, like our new acquaintances,
had never seen any water but the Hudson
River. Indeed, as that majestic stream lay
twenty miles from their home, they had only set
eyes on that at long intervals.</p>

<p>"Look how that ship seems to ride that sea&mdash;as
if those racing waves didn't bother her a bit,"
went on Ned, dwelling on the details of the poster,
which was issued to every postoffice in the
land by the Bureau of Navigation.</p>

<p>"And look at the sailor," urged Herc Taylor,
Ned's cousin. Herc had been christened Hercules
by his parents, who, like Ned's, had died in his
infancy, but Herc he had always been and was
likely to remain.</p>

<p>"What's he waving at&mdash;sea-cows?"</p>

<p>"See here, Herc Taylor, this is serious.
Wouldn't working for Uncle Sam in a uniform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
like that on a first-class fighting-ship suit you
better than doing chores? How would a life on
the ocean wave appeal to you, eh?" inquired Ned,
with rather a mischievous twinkle in his blue
eyes.</p>

<p>"First-rate," rejoined Herc. "It makes me
think of those sea stories&mdash;those you are so fond
of reading, Ned, 'Frank on a Gunboat,' and the
rest."</p>

<p>"I guess a modern Dreadnought is a whole lot
different to the vessels on board which Frank
fought," smiled Ned; "but I must admit that
that picture has put some queer notions into my
head, too."</p>

<p>"For instance, what?" demanded Herc, in
whose eyes there was a glimmer which would
have said plain as a pike-staff to those who knew
him that the red-headed lad had come to some
sort of determination.</p>

<p>"For instance, that I'd like to be a sailor for
Uncle Sam, and work my way up, like some of
those admirals and naval heroes we've read
about!" exclaimed Ned, with considerable animation.</p>

<p>"Shake!" cried Herc; "that's what I've been
thinking of ever since I saw that picture&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Which was ten minutes ago," put in Ned.</p>

<p>"Never mind; you haven't been looking at it
any longer, and I can see that you are as hard
hit by the idea of joining the navy as I am,"
briskly interrupted Herc.</p>

<p>"I don't know but what you are right, Herc,"
rejoined Ned thoughtfully. "I've been thinking
that if we go on as we are, we will be doing the
same old round of duties on grandpa's farm ten
years from now, just as we are doing to-day.
Things don't change much in the country, as you
know, while in the navy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned stopped, but his glowing face and sparkling
eyes finished the speech for him.</p>

<p>"While in the navy, bing! bang!&mdash;Promotion.&mdash;Fire
the guns!&mdash;Target!&mdash;Good shot!&mdash;First
mate!&mdash;Medal!&mdash;Introduction to the president.&mdash;Up
in the fighting-top.&mdash;Down in a submarine.&mdash;Bottom
of the sea.&mdash;Top of the mast&mdash;whoop!"
exploded Herc, in a way that he had when he was
excited. It was for all the world like listening
to the detonations of an exploding package of
firecrackers.</p>

<p>"Well, the poster here <i>does</i> say that there are
a lot of good chances for promotion," soberly put
in Ned, who had been examining the text below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the lithograph with some attention, while Herc
had been exploding. "I've a good mind to try it,
Herc," he concluded suddenly.</p>

<p>"Count me in on that, too," heartily rejoined
his cousin, giving a few impromptu steps of what
he declared was a sailor's hornpipe; "and when
we're both admirals we'll come back here and astonish
the natives&mdash;including Hank Harkins."</p>

<p>"Who said Hank Harkins?" growled a harsh
voice from the rear of the store, for the postoffice
was tucked away in one corner of the Lambs'
Corners Emporium, in which, it was the boast
of its proprietor, you could buy anything from a
needle to a gang-plow.</p>

<p>As the words reached the boys' ears, a tall,
hulking youth, of about their own age&mdash;shouldered
his way through the knot of loungers
gathered about the stove&mdash;for it was December,
and cold.</p>

<p>"I'll thank you two to keep my name out of
your conversation," growled the newcomer, as he
lurched up to the cousins.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'd not use it unless we had to," rejoined
Herc, facing round, his red hair seeming
to bristle like the hackles on the back of an angry
dog. "Since you were mean enough to persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
your father to post his land against us so that we
could not take the short cut to the store, we are
not likely to want to discuss your points,&mdash;good
or otherwise&mdash;promiscuous."</p>

<p>"See here, Herc Taylor," glowered Hank, who
had considerable reputation in the village as a
bully, and had sustained his renown as a hard
fighter and wrestler in many a tough contest,
"I don't know what you mean by promiscuous&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't think you would," grinned Herc
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"But I want to tell you here and now, that if
I have any more of your impudence, I'm going to
lick you, and lick you good," concluded the bully;
his enmity to the two boys, who lived on an adjoining
farm to his father's, not at all allayed by
Herc's aggressive tone and evident contempt.</p>

<p>"And I want to tell you that we don't want anything
to do with you," retorted Herc; "we're
mighty particular about our company."</p>

<p>"You young whelp, I'll have to teach you some
manners," grated Hank angrily, edging up
threateningly toward the red-headed youth, who,
for his part, did not budge the fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>"You'll be a teacher who never studied then,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
retorted Herc hotly, as he turned away to join
Ned, who had been regarding the disputants with
narrowed eyes, but had said nothing so far. He
knew Hank Harkins for a bully, and believed
him to be a coward at heart, but he had no wish
to get into a fistic argument with him in a public
place like Goggins' store and postoffice.</p>

<p>But by this time a number of the loungers about
the stove had become attracted by the raised tones
of Hank and Herc and crowded around the two;
and Hank, nothing loth to having an audience,
proceeded to give Herc what he elegantly termed
a "tongue-lashing."</p>

<p>"So far as posting our farm went," he sputtered
vindictively, "you know why that was done,
to keep you two from pot-hunting over it. Killing
every rabbit you could and pulling down
walls to get them out. Why," exclaimed Hank,
turning to the auditors who stood with gaping
mouths in various interested postures, "those
two fellows made a hole in our south wall that
let our whole herd of milch cows through,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short at a sudden interruption.</p>

<p>"That's a lie." The words came from Ned
Strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, you know it is. You pulled down that
wall yourself and then to escape getting in trouble
with your father you blamed us for it,"
snapped Herc.</p>

<p>The bully's face twitched. He grew pale with
anger and his rage was none the less because
he knew Herc's charges to be true.</p>

<p>"Call me a liar, will you?" he gritted out,
springing at Ned with considerable agility, considering
his hulking frame and general appearance
of clumsy strength.</p>

<p>"Take that!"</p>

<p>Smack!</p>

<p>The bully's big hand landed fair on Ned's
cheek, bruising it and raising an angry crimson
mark.</p>

<p>Unwilling as Ned was to fight in such a place,
the insult was too maddening to be allowed to go
unnoticed by any one but an arrant coward; and
Ned was far from being that.</p>

<p>Before Hank had gathered himself together
from the force of his unexpected blow, the quiet
Ned was transformed from his usual docile self,
into a formidable antagonist. His eyes blazed
with anger as he crouched into a boxing posture
for a breath, and then lunged full at Hank Harkins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
who met the lighter lad's onslaught with
a defiant sneer.</p>

<p>So quickly had it all happened that no one had
had time to say a word, much less to interfere.
Paul Stevens, the owner of the store, was out in
the granary at the back helping a farmer get a
load of oats onto his wagon.</p>

<p>The loungers, nothing averse to having the
monotony of their unceasing discussions of the
crops and politics interrupted in such dramatic
fashion, fell back to give the battlers room. Not
one of them, however, dreamed of but one issue
to the battle and that was that Ned Strong was
in for a terrible thrashing; but, as the seconds
slipped by, and several blows had been exchanged
between the two, it began to appear that Ned
was not going to prove such an easy prey as had
at first seemed manifest.</p>

<p>Hank Harkins himself, who had been surprised
at any resistance from Herc's cousin, began to
look uneasy as Ned, instead of going down
before the perfect hail of blows the bully delivered,
skillfully avoided most of the lunges and
contented himself with ducking and dodging;
only changing his tactics now and then to deliver
a blow when he saw a favorable opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good boy, Ned," breathed Herc, as he saw
his companion wading into Hank Harkins in
such surprising style.</p>

<p>Even the loyal Herc had not hitherto dreamed
that beneath Ned's quiet personality had been
hidden such ability to take care of himself.</p>

<p>Hank, after the first few minutes, was breathing
heavily, and the sweat began to pour off his
face. A pampered, only son, he never did much
hard work about the farm, whereas Ned's
muscles were trained fine as nickel-steel by hay-pitching,
wood-sawing and other strenuous tasks.
His training stood him in good stead now.</p>

<p>Overmatched by Hank, he undoubtedly was,
but his hard frame was the more enduring.
Hank's punches, terrific enough at first, began
gradually to grow weaker, more particularly as
most of them had been wasted on empty space.</p>

<p>Finally Hank, perceiving that he was reaching
the end of his rope, clenched his teeth and, with
set face and narrowed eyes, made up his mind to
end the fight in one supreme effort.</p>

<p>He hurled himself on his lighter antagonist
like a thunderbolt, but Ned, with a skillful duck,
avoided the full fury of the onslaught, and rising
just as the bully launched his blows into thin air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
caught his lumbering opponent full under the
chin.</p>

<p>Swinging his arms, like a scarecrow in a windstorm,
the bully plunged backward under the
effective blow.</p>

<p>"Hurray for Ned Strong!" shouted Herc
ecstatically, as the bully's big frame reeled staggeringly
backward.</p>

<p>The next minute, however, his delight changed
to a groan of dismay as Hank, unable to control
himself, crashed, full tilt, into the stove. With
a deafening clatter, like that of a mad bull
careening round a tinware shop, the heater and
its long pipe, came toppling in a sooty confusion
to the ground. Red-hot coals shot out in every
direction.</p>

<p>In the midst of the wreckage sprawled the unlucky
bully, his features bedaubed with black.
Through this mask his look of puzzled rage at
his defeat came so comically that Ned and Herc
could not restrain themselves, but, even in the
face of the disaster to the store stove, burst into
uncontrollable fits of laughter. In the meantime
some one hurled a bucket of water on the coals,
and the bully was drenched.</p>

<p>The onlookers, their risibilities also tickled by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the downfall of the bully, and the noisy demolition
of the stove, joined in the merriment and the
laden shelves of the store were echoing to a perfect
tempest of laughter when suddenly the rear
door opened and Paul Stevens entered. A look
of dismay appeared on his lean features as his
eyes lighted on the wreckage.</p>

<p>With him was another figure whose unexpected
appearance caused the boys' faces to assume
almost as dismayed a look as the countenance
of the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Grandfather!" gasped Ned, as his eyes encountered
the angry glare of the newcomer's pale
orbs.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;grandfather," snapped the other,
whose weather-beaten face was adorned with a
tuft of gray hair on the chin, in the style popularly
known as "the goatee."</p>

<p>"What have you got to say in explanation of
this?"</p>

<p>As he rasped out this query in a harsh, rusty
voice like the creaking of a long disused hinge,
old Zack Strong pointed to the wreckage. From
the midst of it was rising the bully, plentifully
besmeared with soot, but doing his best to maintain
a look of injured innocence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"WE'RE GOING TO JOIN THE NAVY."</p>


<p>Old Zack Strong was not one of those men
who can distinguish between boyish high spirits
and what he would have termed "downright
pesky cussedness." In this latter quality, indeed,
he believed both his grandsons&mdash;Ned, and his
dead second son's offspring, Herc,&mdash;to be plentifully
endowed. Not naturally bad-hearted, however,
the old man had assumed the care of the
cousins on the death of their parents, but even
with his act of adoption there came the thought
to his frugal mind: "They'll be a great help
'round the farm."</p>

<p>In his hopes in this direction the old man had
not been disappointed. Both boys had entered
into the work with painstaking thoroughness;
but it must be admitted that to adventurous lads,
the monotonous grind of a remote farm in the
hills is somewhat dampening. Ever since Ned
and Herc had left the district school and become,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
in a more thorough sense than ever, "helps" to
their grandfather, the old man had chafed at their
hunting expeditions and proclivities toward baseball
and other games. He could not see that
pitching hay, milking, and doing chores, was not
the full-rounded end of existence for any lads.</p>

<p>So, when, on this bitter December afternoon,
he entered the store unexpectedly on his way back
from delivering a wagon-load of grist at the
water-driven mill at Westerlo, a nearby village,
his chagrin may be imagined when he discovered
his two young charges occupying the centre of
the scene depicted in the last chapter.</p>

<p>In Zack Strong's hard creed there was only
one sin worse than playing&mdash;or "fooling," as he
called it&mdash;and that was fighting.</p>

<p>And it was only too evident that in the latter
of these heinous offences one at least of the boys
had been indulging.</p>

<p>Worse still, in the wrecked stove the old
farmer foresaw a demand for damages on the
storekeeper's part, and there was only one thing
harder to wring from Zack than a smile, and
that article was money. If the average farmer
is what may be described as "close-fisted," old
Zack was "cement-fisted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>With this side-light on their grandfather's
character in view, the consternation of the boys
may be understood when they met his amazed
and indignant gaze resting accusingly on them.</p>

<p>"Mean?" stammered Hank, wiping as best he
could some of the soot off his mottled countenance
and echoing the old man's last words. "It means
that your two boys here have made a brutal and
unprovoked attack on me and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that my stove is busted to Kingdom
Come!" disgustedly sputtered Paul Stevens,
whose cadaverous features had been busily scanning
the wreckage in the brief interval of time
that had elapsed between the entrance of himself
and Zack Strong and the seemingly righteously
indignant outburst of the bully.</p>

<p>"Never mind your stove now," grated out the
hard-featured old farmer, wishing devoutly that
the stove could be "never-minded" altogether,
"what I want to find out is what these boys here
have been up to. What kind of deviltry they
have been at."</p>

<p>"We haven't been at any deviltry, as you please
to call it, grandpa," burst out Ned, striving to
keep cool, though he was burning inwardly with
indignation and humiliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh-eh-eh?" grunted the old man incredulously,
"that's fine talking, but what's all this I see?
How did that young man come to be all mixed
up in the stove?"</p>

<p>"Through no wish of his own you may be
sure," chuckled the irrepressible Herc. "Say,
Hank, you look like a skunk&mdash;all black and white,
you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir," roared his grandfather, with as
near an approach to a stern bass as his wheezy
voice would allow. "Who started this?"</p>

<p>Ned remained silent. It was not his wish to
tell tales, and he had no desire to act as an informer.</p>

<p>"Why, Hank Harkins here started it," spoke
up Si Ingalls, a young farmer who had formed
one of the group about the demolished stove, "he
slapped Ned in the jaw and Ned&mdash;rightly, too&mdash;came
back at him. Am I correct?" he asked,
turning to the others.</p>

<p>"Hank's face looks it," grinned Luke Bates,
the village wit, regarding Hank, who was quivering
with fury, in an amused way, "never mix
it up with a stove, Hank," he went on, "it'll get
the best of you every time."</p>

<p>"Is this right?" demanded old Zack, turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
his grandson as soon as the laugh at Hank's expense
subsided.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's about the way it happened, I
guess," said Ned in a low voice.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is who's going to settle
for my stove," wailed Paul Stevens. "Here's a
cracked draught-piece, a busted door, two lengths
of stove-pipe flattened out like pancakes and soot
all over a fine piece of dress goods."</p>

<p>"Name your price," groaned old Zack, wincing
as if a twinge of rheumatism had passed through
him, "but don't make it too steep," he added, cautiously,
"or I won't pay it. How much, now?"</p>

<p>The storekeeper made a rapid mental calculation,
in which his fingers and various grimaces
played an important part.</p>

<p>"There's the stove door, say seventy-five cents;
and the pipe, two lengths, a dollar; and the
draught-piece&mdash;I'll have to send to New York
for another, sixty cents; and the spoiled dress
goods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll only have to cut the outside edge off
them," objected old Zack, his lips twitching
nervously as the rising tide of expenses swamped
his cautious senses.</p>

<p>"Wall, that'll be a yard, anyhow," announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the storekeeper, "that is twenty-five cents, we'll
say. Two dollars thirty-five for the whole shebang."</p>

<p>"Two dollars thirty-five. It's rank robbery,"
objected the old farmer, almost giving utterance
to a groan.</p>

<p>"Of course I may be able to straighten out the
stove pipe," admitted Paul Stevens, reluctantly,
"and you are an old customer. I'll make it two
dollars and ten cents to you."</p>

<p>Reluctantly old Zack drew out a battered wallet
and drew from it two one-dollar bills, being
careful not to display the rest of its contents.
Then, after much fumbling in the recesses of his
clothing, he produced a small leather purse from
which he drew a ten cent piece. These he tendered
with an agonized expression to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Canadian," sniffed the storekeeper, regarding
the bit of silver.</p>

<p>"It's good," objected old Zack.</p>

<p>"Not to me. Come, I let you off light on the
stove and the other damage them boys have done;
give me a good dime."</p>

<p>Reluctantly old Zack took back the rejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
coin and substituted for it a piece of United
States silver.</p>

<p>"There you are," he grumbled, "those pesky
boys will bankrupt me yet."</p>

<p>All this time the boys, standing aloof from the
crowd of loungers, had regarded the scene with
very different expressions. Herc's lips trembled
with suppressed laughter as he witnessed the
painful operation of separating old Zack from
his beloved money, while Ned's face bore a
thoughtful look, as if he were revolving some
serious project in his mind. Hank Harkins had
taken advantage of the temporary diversion from
himself as a centre of interest to shuffle off, and
was by this time well on his way home, considering,
as he went, the best way in which he could
explain his soot-smeared face and rapidly swelling
eye.</p>

<p>A short time afterwards the boys accompanied
their elder to his spring-wagon and, as they had
walked down to the store, prepared to accompany
him home.</p>

<p>"Look out for squalls," Herc whispered to Ned,
as the two lads unhitched the team. His warning
was not ill-judged. The vials of old Zack's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
wrath burst with the fury of a midsummer storm
above the boys' heads as soon as the wagon had
clattered out of the village and was climbing the
steep ascent to Zack Strong's farm.</p>

<p>"Of all the useless, idle scamps that I ever had
on the farm, you are the worst," began the
querulous old man, "and then, to cap it all, you
go to fighting and brawling in public and cost
me two dollars and an American dime to settle it.
I don't see why Paul Stevens couldn't have taken
that Canadian one. They're as good as any others,
in some places," he went on, his mind reverting
to his other grievance, "but that's the way in
this world, nothing but ingratitude everywhere
you turn. I've nourished a pair of sar-pints,
that's what I've done. You're rattle-brains,
both on yer."</p>

<p>He turned a sour enough countenance on the
two lads as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Sort of rattlesnakes, eh?" cheerfully remarked
the irrepressible Herc. "It's no use being
angry, gran'pa," he went on, "we'd finished
splitting the last of that tough hickory before we
came down to the village and, as there was nothing
else to do till chore-time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You spent it in disgracing yourselves, eh?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
grimly rejoined old Zack. "I'm tired of it, I tell
you," he railed on, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And so are we," quietly broke in Ned,
whose face still wore the same thoughtful
look that had come over it just before they left
the store.</p>

<p>"What?" quavered the old man, as if he
thought he had not heard aright.</p>

<p>"I mean 'so are we tired of it,'" repeated Ned,
slowly, but in a firm voice, "we work for you
early and late, grandpa, and nothing ever comes
of it but scolding and fault-finding."</p>

<p>"Didn't I pay two dollars ten cents for that
busted stove, Ned?" complained old Zack, "and
I'll swear the damage wasn't more'n one ninety-eight,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's not the question, now," went on Ned,
in the same quiet, determined voice, "as it was
partly my fault that the stove was overturned I'll
pay you back that out of my own pocket."</p>

<p>"What,&mdash;you ain't got no money!" exclaimed
old Zack incredulously and in somewhat alarmed
tones. There was a note in Ned's voice he had
never heard there before and he saw his authority
melting away like snow in the spring, "and besides,
maybe I was a bit hasty, Ned. Come, we'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
call it square and you do your work right in
future and we'll say no more about it."</p>

<p>"I shall do only a little more work for you,
gran'pa," was Ned's amazing reply, which almost
caused the old man to drop his lines and fall
backward off his seat.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he cried, and his voice fairly
squeaked under the stress of his great astonishment.</p>

<p>"I said," calmly repeated Ned, "that I shall not
do much more work for you, grandpa, and neither
will Herc here, I guess. We are going away."</p>

<p>It was Herc's turn to look astonished. Accustomed
as he was to accept Ned's opinion in
most things, this latest resolve seemed somewhat
drastic even to the impetuous red-headed youth.</p>

<p>"Why, you ain't got no money?" stammered
old Zack, not being able to think of anything else
to say in his great amazement.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have," quietly rejoined Ned. "I
have fifty dollars saved up that I got for skins
last winter and Herc has about the same sum.
That will carry us a little way, I guess."</p>

<p>"Why, Ned, boy! Land o' Goshen, what have
yer set yer mind on doin'?" gasped the farmer.</p>

<p>"We're going to enter the navy," announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Ned, in these same quiet, determined tones; which
unmistakably meant to anyone who knew him
that his mind was made up beyond the possibility
of change.</p>

<p>"What, out on the water?" gasped old Zack,
his mind in a whirl at this sudden kicking over
the traces of authority.</p>

<p>"I believe they usually sail the vessels of Uncle
Sam's navy on the water," chirped the irrepressible
Herc, who, his first astonishment over, had
quite resolved to follow his cousin's footsteps
wherever they might lead.</p>

<p>The sarcasm was lost on old Zack, however.
He even forgot to emit his customary minute
interval cry of "Geddap!" to his old team which,
in consequence, came to a dead standstill in the
middle of the road.</p>

<p>"Of course we shall stay and help you till you
get a hired man to suit you," went on Ned, with
quiet sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," quavered the old man, chirruping
to his stationary team, and seemingly dazed by
the sudden announcement of the boys' intentions.</p>

<p>"In the navy&mdash;out on the water," he muttered
as they drove on, "Land o' Goshen!&mdash;two dollars!&mdash;fights!&mdash;busted
stoves!&mdash;the navy!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">UNCLE SAM GETS TWO RAW RECRUITS.</p>


<p>Old Zack's daze was not dispelled the next
morning when, having done their work as usual,
the boys set off to trudge the six miles into
Lambs' Corners.</p>

<p>"Will you be back to dinner?" the old man
croaked, in such a quavering voice that even
Herc felt sorry for him.</p>

<p>"We'll be back before then, and make up the
time we've lost before night," Ned assured him,
as the two cousins swung off to take what they
both felt was the final step of their resolve.</p>

<p>They had lain awake most of the night in the
room they shared, discussing the future, and had
decided to abide by the decision they had so
hastily arrived at, whatever might happen.</p>

<p>"Things have come to the cross roads of opportunity,"
was the way Ned put it, "we've got
to strike out now and sink or swim."</p>

<p>During the course of their conversation it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
occurred to Ned that in reading over the printed
matter beneath the picture which had attracted
their attention in the post office the day before,
he had come across instructions to ask the postmaster
for a post card, which was free on application.
This card, when mailed to the Navy
Department, so the poster said, would bring the
applicant additional information regarding the
navy, in the form of booklets and pamphlets.</p>

<p>As soon as the boys arrived in the postoffice
they perceived that they were the objects of very
general scrutiny by the usual group assembled
'round the re-erected stove. They paid no attention
to the comments of the knot of spectators,
however, but marched straight up to the little
pigeon hole, behind which Paul Stevens attended
to the weighty matters of the U. S. mail, and
demanded two of the post cards the poster mentioned.
With a lifting of his eyebrows the postmaster
handed them out.</p>

<p>"Seems like everyone in the place is goin' ter
enlist, or whatever you call it," he remarked.
"Hank Harkins was in here early to-day and
got one of them cards. I reckon he's thinking of
getting a chore boy's job in the navy, too."</p>

<p>This was news to the boys and not particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
welcome news, either. They had no desire to
come into further contact with the lumbering
Hank, but inasmuch as they had no control over
his movements, they accepted the situation with
the best grace they could.</p>

<p>A few days later the literature arrived from
Washington and the boys put their heads together
over it during their leisure time, examining
the prospects held out from every aspect.
The result was, as might have been expected,
that their resolution became more firmly set than
ever and a week after they received the booklets
and other information they bade good-bye to
old Zack, who had by this time acquired resignation
and a hired man, and started for the
village whence they were to take the stage to
Granville, the railroad town.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the boys felt little regret
on leaving the farm and old Zack, and were not
hypocrites enough to pretend to any great affection
for their surroundings of so many monotonous
years. Old Zack wrung his hands and
lamented, to be sure, but as the boys knew that
his grief was caused more by the loss of two
husky helpers than by any personal regret, they
did not pay much attention to his protestations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>As they strode through the old farm gates
there did come over them a momentary twinge
of feeling at the idea that the portals that they
had so often opened and shut as they went about
their work, were closing behind them for perhaps
the last time. It was only a momentary
emotion, however, and was speedily dispelled by
a shout of "Hey!" from old Zack, who came
running after them from the barn where he had
spent the time since, he had said good-by, in
scolding the new hired man.</p>

<p>The two lads halted and set down their brand
new suit-cases in the dusty track.</p>

<p>"Say!" panted old Zack, clumsily loping up to
them, and holding out something in his withered
fingers, "here's something you boys may need.
Take it, anyhow; I'll give it yer."</p>

<p>In his digits he extended to them the Canadian
dime, rejected by the postmaster on the afternoon
of the disaster to the stove.</p>

<p>Hardly able to restrain their laughter, the boys
accepted the gift with becoming gravity, and once
more said farewell to the old man.</p>

<p>"It'll do as a luck-piece, anyhow," laughed
Ned, as they trudged on and a turn in the road
blotted out from their eyes the old farm-house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
its weather-beaten out-buildings and fertile fields.
It was to be many a day before they saw it again
and many adventures, of which they little
dreamed at the moment, were to be experienced
by them before they once more encountered it.</p>

<p>In due time the stage reached the Granville
ferry and five hours later the railroad brought
the two lads down the east bank of the Hudson
to New York. They stood dazed and confused
outside the Grand Central station looking with
amazed eyes on the roar and confusion of traffic
that swirled by them. It was mid afternoon and
they had yet to report at the recruiting station,
of which they had the address in their pockets.</p>

<p>Ned stepped up to a policeman who stood at
the crossing directing the flow of traffic by blasts
on a whistle.</p>

<p>He extended the piece of paper which bore the
address: "U. S. Navy Recruiting Station, No.
394 Bowery," on it.</p>

<p>"Can you please tell us how to get there?" he
asked, somewhat tremblingly. It was the first
real live policeman he had ever addressed, and
the country boy felt somewhat awed.</p>

<p>"I'm a traffic cop. Ask the man on post,"
snapped the policeman. With a sharp blast on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
his whistle he started the cross-town traffic,
which had halted, to moving again, paying no
further attention to the tall sun-burned lad with
the shining new suit-case.</p>

<p>Somewhat taken aback at this reception, the lad
looked at his companion with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>"I guess he regulates the traffic," suggested
Herc, in response to the silent query, "see that
horse's head in a wheel embroidered on his arm?
Let's look for a policeman without that and I
guess he'll be the right man to inquire from."</p>

<p>Following Herc's suggestion Ned's eyes soon
lighted on a stout bluecoat who stood talking to
a number of taxi-cab drivers and seemed to have
nothing to do with the regulation of traffic; or,
in fact, anything else. This time he got a quick
answer to his question.</p>

<p>"394 Bowery," repeated the patrolman, "shure
any one knows where that is," and he looked
at Ned and Herc pityingly as if they were some
strange sort of creatures and much to be sympathized
with.</p>

<p>"Yes, officer, but we are strangers in the city,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure, any one could tell you were Rubes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the cut of your jibs," grinned the patrolman,
while the taxi-cabbies set up a laugh. "Goin' ter
enlist in the navy, eh?" he went on, scrutinizing
Ned's bit of paper, "well, Heaven help ye.
They'll feed ye on skilly, and milk from a tin-cow,
and put yer ter bed in a haythanish hammock
of nights."</p>

<p>"We are going to become sailors in Uncle
Sam's navy," proudly rejoined Ned, "and we
think it's a service which any man should be
proud to be privileged to join."</p>

<p>His face flushed indignantly, and he felt a
flash of anger at the contemptuous tone of the
fat policeman.</p>

<p>"Oh well, be aisy," rejoined the bluecoat, "I
meant no harm; but my wife's sister's cousin
Mary had a son as went for sailor and they
brought him home in a coffin, that's all. He was
blowed to bits by an explosion of one of the big
guns. The police force is good enough for me
and by the same token I should think two likely
looking lads like you would like to jine the force."</p>

<p>"Our time is limited," broke in the still indignant
Ned, "will you please direct us to the
address I showed you?"</p>

<p>"Shure I will, me bye," amiably replied the unruffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
patrolman, "walk to your left two blocks
and take a Third Avenue car down town. When
she gets onto the Bowery watch the numbers and
you can't miss it."</p>

<p>With a brief word of thanks the boys hastened
off in the direction indicated. As they walked
away they heard the policeman remark to his
friends, the chauffeurs:</p>

<p>"Waal, there goes more food for powder."</p>

<p>"I'm glad we're not staying in New York. I
don't believe I should care much for it," said
Herc, as the boys walked toward Third Avenue,
their ears stunned by the din all about them.</p>

<p>"Nor I," responded Ned. "However, if we
pass our tests and are accepted, we shall not
have to stop here longer than overnight. That's
one comfort."</p>

<p>"That's so," assented Herc. "I used to think
there was an ear-splitting racket about the place
on hog-killing day, but it was nothing to this."</p>

<p>Thus conversing they boarded a Third Avenue
car and rode for half an hour or more.</p>

<p>"Here you are, boys&mdash;here's Number 394."</p>

<p>The conductor of the car poked his head in
through the doors and gave his bell one jerk,
which brought it to a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys hastened from the car, and found
themselves opposite a not particularly prepossessing
looking building, the lower floor of which was
occupied by an old book store. But above an
open door leading to the upper stories, which had
been newly painted and presented a neat appearance,
floated a flag that made both their hearts
beat quicker. If all went well, they would soon
be enlisted under it. Old Glory hung bravely
above the dingy portal, amid the hurry and
squalidness of the surroundings.</p>

<p>"Well, here's the place, Herc."</p>

<p>But to Ned's surprise, Herc stopped short and
was standing irresolutely behind him.</p>

<p>"Um-ah! I guess we'd better walk around the
block a couple of times first, Ned," stammered
the red-headed youth.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" laughed Ned. "You
look as awkward as a hired man going courting.
You don't mean to say that you are nervous?"</p>

<p>"No," protested Herc, "not nervous, Ned; but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; Well,
the fact is, I'd have liked a
little preparation first, as the fellow said when
he fell into the well on Luke Bates' place up
home."</p>

<p>"You're going to come in with me right now,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
said Ned grimly, seizing Herc's arm in a grip
there was no resisting.</p>

<p>Together the two lads passed through the door
and up a flight of stairs. At the head of the flight
they found a well-furnished office confronting
them. A rather brusque-looking man, with a pair
of formidable mustaches, sat at a table facing
them.</p>

<p>"Well?" he demanded somewhat truculently.</p>

<p>"Well," the irrepressible Herc was beginning
in the same aggressive tone, when Ned checked
him.</p>

<p>"We wish to enlist in the navy. Have we come
to the right place, sir?" he asked civilly.</p>

<p>"You have, my boys," was the response in
heartier tone; "and if you mean business, I think
I can promise, from looking you over casually,
that you'll pass with flying colors. Fill out these
blanks, and I'll see what you're made of. We
have so many fakes we have to be careful."</p>

<p>He pushed toward the boys two large sheets of
paper. On them were printed numerous questions
about themselves, their parents, their previous
condition of life, and so forth.</p>

<p>"Gee! this is like passing an examination at
school," whispered Herc, as the boys sat down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
with pen and ink at a corner table and prepared
to fill out the blank spaces left for answers.</p>

<p>"Hush!" cautioned Ned.</p>

<p>"Or the papers you fill out when you enter a
prize heifer at the county fair," continued the
incorrigible red-headed youth.</p>

<p>Despite Herc's frequent remarks, breathed in
a cautious undertone, the questions were all answered
in due time and the papers handed over to
the bristly mustached man, who eyed them approvingly.</p>

<p>"Good!" he snapped. "Neat and satisfactory.
Now," he continued, "go into that room and undergo
a physical examination."</p>

<p>He indicated a door, which the boys opened
with somewhat of a feeling of awe, and found
themselves in the presence of a surgeon, who ordered
them to disrobe and conducted a thorough
examination of them.</p>

<p>"Just as if we were a pair of fat porkers," commented
Herc afterward.</p>

<p>"They are magnificent physical specimens," reported
the surgeon to the bristly mustached man,
who, though the boys did not then know it, was
a quartermaster detailed to recruiting duty.</p>

<p>"Good!" snapped the quartermaster once more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
"They have already given me the written consent
of their guardian, so nothing remains to be done
but to administer the oath."</p>

<p>The solemn oath of allegiance to duty and
country was then administered to the boys, who
stood bolt upright, with round eyes, while the
impressive little ceremony was gone through.
Even the volatile Herc seemed impressed by the
seriousness of what they were undertaking.</p>

<p>"And now we are blue jackets," said Ned, as
they concluded and subscribed their names to the
oath.</p>

<p>"Not yet," laughed the quartermaster. "You
will now have to go to the Naval Training School
at Newport as apprentice seamen."</p>

<p>"Only apprentices," sighed Herc. "I thought
we were out of that class."</p>

<p>"As apprentice seamen," went on the officer,
not noticing the interruption, "you will receive
pay during your four months of instruction, and
will be furnished uniforms and equipment free, as
well as board."</p>

<p>He reached into a drawer.</p>

<p>"Here is your transportation to Newport. The
boat leaves to-night at six o'clock," he went on,
handing the boys some tickets. "I hope you boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
who look to be the stuff of which real seamen are
made, will work hard and succeed."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. We will if effort counts for
anything," promised Ned.</p>

<p>With light hearts the two boys made their way
to the street a few minutes later. As they passed
under the flag once more, Ned drew himself up
stiffly and saluted.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" asked Herc curiously,
as he watched his companion's action.</p>

<p>"Because we are now sailors under that flag in
the United States navy," replied Ned proudly.
"You should do the same, Herc. We're Dreadnought
Boys from now on."</p>

<p>"All right. I will salute next time," easily responded
Herc. "And now, as we have some few
hours before the boat goes, let's saunter round a
bit and see the sights."</p>

<p>As the boys, having inquired the way, started
toward Broadway, they almost collided with a tall
figure that was hastening into the door of the
recruiting office.</p>

<p>"Out of my way, can't you?" the newcomer
exclaimed querulously, shoving roughly by.
"What are you barricading the door of the naval
recruiting office for? I'll report you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're here because we are now apprentice
seamen in the navy, Hank Harkins," rejoined
Ned, who had recognized the bully before the
other had realized with whom he had almost collided.</p>

<p>Hank glanced angrily at the two lads, but refrained
from speaking. Instead, he hurried up
the stairs leading to the recruiting office, paying
no attention to his country's flag.</p>

<p>"There goes a fine addition to the navy,"
sneered Herc, as the boys started off for Broadway.</p>

<p>"Don't say that, Herc. The navy may make a
man of him," remarked Ned.</p>

<p>"Then it's got a fine big job on its hands, that's
all I've got to say!" was the red-headed lad's rejoinder.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS HAVE AN
ADVENTURE.</p>


<p>The <i>Rhode Island</i>, the largest and fleetest of
the big passenger vessels plying Long Island
Sound between New York and New England
ports, was ploughing her way through a wild,
bitter night in the latter part of March, down
the narrow, tempestuous passage of water dividing
the mainland from the low-lying expanse of
Long Island.</p>

<p>Although the snow swirled and the wind
screamed through the vessel's funnel stays and
lofty wireless aerials as if it would root them
out, every window and porthole on her three lofty
decks glowed with a cheerful yellow light. The
lively strains of an orchestra were occasionally
swirled away on the fierce wind, when the door
of the main saloon swung open to admit or give
egress to a passenger.</p>

<p>The laboring vessel had run into the storm at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
sundown that evening, and now, as she forged
her way through the choppy seas off Point Judith,
she was, despite her great size, thrown and
tossed about like an empty bottle at the mercy of
the seas.</p>

<p>As the vessel gave an unusually heavy plunge,
the companion door once more opened, and in
the sudden flood of light that illumined the dark
decks for a brief interval, the stalwart figures of
the two Dreadnought Boys were revealed. Both
wore heavy "service" overcoats buttoned up to
their chins, and these they secured more tightly
about themselves as they faced the storm.</p>

<p>Both lads were heavier, even more bronzed,
and keener of eye than when we saw them last.
Their four months of vigorous training had, too,
given them a manly air of self-reliance.</p>

<p>"Wow!" exclaimed Herc, as the wind hit them
full and square and gave pause for a second even
to their well-knit frames. "This is a hummer, and
no mistake, Ned!"</p>

<p>"Nothing to what we'll get when we go cruising
under Uncle Sam's flag," laughed the other.
"I tell you, Herc, that this isn't a circumstance to
the gales I've heard they get off Cape Hatteras."</p>

<p>"Why, what are you talking about?" rejoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Herc, pulling his cap closer over his head of
bright red hair. "This wind is worse than the
one that blew the roof off gran'pa's barn last New
Year's eve, and that was a hummer, if you like
it!"</p>

<p>"Still thinking of the old farm and Lambs'
Corners, eh?" laughed his companion, with a
hearty chuckle that sounded as if it came from
the depth of his full, deep chest and excellent
lungs. "Well, now that you're a full-fledged
jackie, Herc, it's time to forget the stock and
the barnyard, and think of the big guns and the
fighting tops."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," grunted Herc, as if to change
the conversation, "blowing as it is, I'd rather be
out here than in that stuffy saloon, for all
the lights and the music and the dressed-up
ladies."</p>

<p>"Same here," rejoined his companion. "Crickey!
that was a lurch, if you like! Hold on, Herc!"
he shouted, as the other went sliding off across
the slippery deck, under the impetus of the plunge.
"We don't want to lose you just yet, you know.
And, moreover, this is no skating rink, but a
passenger steamer carrying two new-fledged ordinary
seamen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blamed ordinary!" grunted Herc, in parenthesis.</p>

<p>"From the Naval Training School at Newport
to New York, to join their ship, the U. S. S. <i>Manhattan</i>,"
went on Ned.</p>

<p>"Dreadnought, isn't she?" sputtered Herc, as
a great, hurtling mass of spray was flung aboard
by the angry wind.</p>

<p>"That's right. The newest vessel in the navy.
We're mighty lucky boys to have got the berths."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," rejoined Herc, brushing
his hand across his eyes, where the tang of the
salt water still stung him. "I'd be altogether as
satisfied as a woodchuck in a corn patch if only
that fellow Hank Harkins hadn't been detailed to
the same squadron. He means to give us trouble,
Ned. I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of any trouble that a bullying
cad like Harkins can make," was Ned's brisk reply.
"Anyhow, he is detailed to duty on the
<i>Illinois</i>; and now, Herc, we've been standing here
long enough. We'll take a brisk walk around
the decks, to get the cobwebs out of our brains,
and then we'll turn in&mdash;how's that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Fine," rejoined Herc, as the two young seamen
started to circle the swaying decks at a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
brisk pace. "I'm as sleepy as Uncle Fred's prize
Berkshire after a bran mash."</p>

<p>Immediately on being passed at the New York
recruiting office, the lads, as we know, had been
ordered to report at the training station at Newport,
where they had remained for the prescribed
four months, being given in that period a thorough
schooling in the detail work of the ordinary
seaman in the United States navy. They had also
gone through setting-up exercises that had, even
in that short period of time, changed their physiques
from the somewhat round-shouldered,
slouching aspect peculiar to country boys to the
smart appearance and trim get-up of Uncle Sam's
sailors.</p>

<p>While in the school they had received a salary
of seventeen dollars and sixty cents a month, and
as uniforms, food and washing were all provided
by the government, they had incurred no expenses,
and had a good part of their money in
their pockets when they left the training-school
with their "papers" endorsed "Excellent" in red
ink, with a special "good-conduct" mention.</p>

<p>That afternoon they had embarked on the
<i>Rhode Island</i> for New York, where the vessels
of the North Atlantic squadron lay in the North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
River, awaiting the command to leave for the
naval base, at Guantanamo, Cuba, for battle practice.</p>

<p>"Well, Herc," said Ned, after the two lads had
circumnavigated the slippery decks a few times,
"let's turn in, for, if I'm not mistaken, we have
a trying day in front of us to-morrow."</p>

<p>As the boys were unlocking the door of their
stateroom, which opened directly onto the deck,
the <i>Rhode Island</i> gave a plunge that brought her
almost on her beam-ends, and sent Herc, who was
balancing himself as best he could, while Ned
fiddled with the lock, careening full against a
tall, gray-mustached man of upright bearing, who
was just about to open the door of the stateroom
adjoining the boys'.</p>

<p>Herc's heavy frame, with the added impetus
given to it by the swerve of the vessel, banged
into the other with the force of a projectile, and
the two went struggling helplessly toward the
scuppers.</p>

<p>Strive desperately as he would, Herc could not
regain his balance, and after waving his long,
sinewy arms round a couple of times in a vain
effort to recover his equilibrium, he collapsed in
a heap at the edge of the deck. In his fall he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
brought down the dignified gentleman, who in the
meantime had been striving as hard as Herc to
keep upright.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, I'm sure!" sputtered
Herc, as he scrambled to his feet and
reached out a hand to assist the other to a standing
position. "It was quite an accident&mdash;as
gran'pa said when Betsey, our muley cow, kicked
Lem Betts in the eye."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lad," responded the other, accepting
Herc's aid and standing erect once more.
"I am sure that, as in the case of your grandfather's
cow, the disaster was unintentional."</p>

<p>The boys, for Ned had by this time unlocked
the door, and had been taking in the embarrassing
incident, regarded the tall stranger with some interest.
He was distinctly different from the ordinary
citizen. His skin was bronzed and weather-beaten,
and, beneath his close-cropped gray
mustache, his mouth quivered humorously at poor
Herc's obvious embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Why," went on the object of their attention,
regarding them in the light which streamed from
the open cabin door of the boys' stateroom, "I
see that you lads are both recruits to the navy.
What ship, may I ask?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"The new Dreadnought <i>Manhattan</i>, sir," said
Ned, proudly throwing out his chest, as he always
did instinctively when he mentioned the name of
the big fighting ship to which they had been assigned.</p>

<p>The gray-mustached man's eyes twinkled more
than ever.</p>

<p>"The <i>Manhattan</i>, eh?" he repeated reflectively.
"Well, in that case we shall probably see more of
each other. In any case, I thank you for your
assistance"&mdash;turning to Herc&mdash;"rendered after
you had 'boarded' me in such unceremonious fashion."</p>

<p>With a pleasant smile, he turned into his cabin,
picking up as he did so a suitcase which had been
deposited by him at the stateroom door, just before
the unhappy Herc went careening across the
deck.</p>

<p>"Say," whispered Herc, in an awed tone, as
their new acquaintance vanished into his room,
"did you see the letters on the end of the suitcase?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Ned sleepily, "I'm too tired
to pay attention to anything but that snug-looking
bunk there."</p>

<p>So saying, he closed the door on the storm, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
seating himself on the edge of a lounge at one
end of the cabin, began to remove his shoes.</p>

<p>But Herc would not let the subject drop.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> noticed them," he continued in the
same awed voice, "and I believe that we've got
ourselves in bad right on the start."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the trouble, Herc?" inquired
Ned, interested despite himself in his red-headed
companion's eager tone.</p>

<p>"Well," said Herc impressively, "it said 'F. A.
D., Commander U. S. N.,' on that suitcase, and
it looks to me as if we had started our career in
the navy by an act 'of gross insubordination,' as
they'd have called it at Newport."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" asked the sleepy Ned,
stifling a yawn.</p>

<p>"Why, here am I, Herc Taylor, ordinary seaman,
of Lambs' Corners, New York, butting commanders
about as if they were ninepins and I was
a bowling ball, that's all!" groaned Herc. "And
that looks to me like a first-class way to get in
bad."</p>

<p>"Herc, you are incorrigible," groaned Ned;
"and I agree with you. If this adventure of yours
doesn't turn out badly for both of us, I shall be
much surprised."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TWO LADS WITH THE "RIGHT RING."</p>


<p>It seemed to Herc that he had been asleep but a
short time when he awakened with a start and
an uneasy feeling that he could not account for.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, as the semi-stupor that
followed the opening of his eyes wore off and he
became sensible of his surroundings, he was
aware that something unusual seemed to be occurring
on the ship. Shouts and the trampling
of running feet were borne in to him, and his
first sleepy impression was that it was morning.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, he became aware that the
shouts formed a certain definite cry.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>Herc straightened up as well as he could in his
bunk and listened.</p>

<p>A thrill of horror shot through him, as, like
a flash, he sensed the nature of the shouts that
had aroused him.</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The terrifying cry echoed from bow to stern
of the ship and Herc now recognized a fact which
he had not in first sleepy stupor realized, and that
was that their cabin was hazy with smoke, which
was becoming momentarily thicker. The heat,
also, was growing rapidly insupportable.</p>

<p>With one bound, the boy was on the floor, and
shaking Ned by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ned, Ned, wake up!" he roared at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" came in a sleepy voice from
Ned, who was dreaming that he was still back in
the training school and that reveille had blown.</p>

<p>A minute later, however, Herc's shaking
aroused him to his senses, and a few rapidly
spoken words apprised him of the seriousness of
the situation.</p>

<p>"Tumble into your clothes quick!" gasped Herc,
as breathing in the smoke-filled room became
every moment more difficult.</p>

<p>Ned needed no second telling. In a few seconds,
thanks to their training, both boys were in
their uniforms, and, grabbing up their suitcases,
dashed out onto the decks.</p>

<p>The scene outside was one that might have
turned cooler heads than theirs. The storm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
still raging, and a white swirl enveloped the laboring
ship, but the whiteness of the snow was
tinged a fiery red with the reflections of towering
flames that were by this time pouring from the
engine-room hatch of the <i>Rhode Island</i>, and illuminating
the night with their devouring splendor.
Fire originating in a pile of oily waste against a
wooden bulkhead had started the blaze.</p>

<p>Men and women in all stages of dress and undress
rushed confusedly about the decks, praying,
screaming, blaspheming and fighting.</p>

<p>In the emergency that had so suddenly arisen,
the crew and officers of the ship seemed powerless
to do anything. Instead of attempting to
quiet the panic, they rushed about, apparently as
maddened as the rest of the persons on the ship,
by the dire peril that confronted them.</p>

<p>"The boats! The boats!" someone suddenly
shouted, and a mad rush for the upper decks, on
which the boats were swung, followed. Women
were flung aside by cowardly men frenzied with
terror.</p>

<p>"Here, I can't stand this!" shouted Ned, as,
followed by Herc, he plunged toward the foot of
the narrow stairway up which the frenzied passengers
were fighting their way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Women and children first! Women and children
first!" the Dreadnought Boy kept shouting,
as he elbowed his way to the foot of the steps,
closely trailed by Herc.</p>

<p>The roar of the flames was by this time deafening,
drowning all other sounds. To add to the
confusion, there now came pouring up from the
lower regions of the ship a black and sooty crew&mdash;the
firemen of the vessel. Maddened by fear
and brutal by nature, the grimy stokers had
little difficulty in shoving the weaker passengers
aside and making their way to the foot
of the stairway up which Ned and Herc were
helping the women and children and keeping
back the cowardly male passengers as best
they could. They were not over gentle in
doing this latter. It was no time for halfway
measures.</p>

<p>Above them, the captain of the ship and two
of his officers who had partially collected their
wits, were directing the crew to lower the boats.
The women and children were being placed in
them as rapidly as possible as Ned and Herc
passed them up.</p>

<p>"Can you hold them back?" the captain had
shouted down to the boys a few minutes before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
as he peered down at the struggling mass on the
lower deck.</p>

<p>"We'll stick it out as long as we can," Ned
had assured him, as he whirled a terrified male
passenger about and sent him spinning backward
whining pitifully that he "didn't want
to die."</p>

<p>Suddenly Herc was confronted by a huge form,
brandishing a steel spanner in a knotty fist.</p>

<p>It was one of the panic-stricken firemen.</p>

<p>"Let me by, kid!" bellowed this formidable antagonist.</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself that there are several
women to go yet," responded Herc calmly, although
he felt anything but easy in his mind as
the muscular giant glared at him with terror
and vindictiveness mingling in his gaze. "Women
first, that's the rule."</p>

<p>"What in blazes do I care about the women?"
roared the fireman, behind whom were now
ranged several of his companions. "Let me by,
or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He flourished the spanner with a suggestive
motion anything but agreeable to Herc.</p>

<p>The red-headed boy gazed over in the direction
in which he had last seen Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no hope for help from that quarter,
as a glance showed him. Ned was holding back
an excited man with long whiskers and of prosperous
appearance, who was shouting as if he
were a phonograph:</p>

<p>"A thousand dollars for a seat in the boats!
A thousand&mdash;two thousand dollars for a seat in
the boats!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, so suddenly that Herc had not time
to guard against it, the stokers made a concerted
rush for him.</p>

<p>"Ned! Ned!" shouted the boy, as he felt himself
borne down by overwhelming numbers and
trampled underfoot.</p>

<p>Ned heard the cry, and in two leaps was in
the midst of the scuffle, dealing and receiving
blows right and left.</p>

<p>"Do you call yourselves men?" he shouted indignantly,
as the stokers fought their way forward
in a grim phalanx which there was no resisting.</p>

<p>"It's deuce take the hindmost, and every man
for himself now!" shouted a voice in the crowd,
and the cowardly mob elbowed forward through
the few women that still remained on the stairway
and its approaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned and Herc, who had by this time struggled
to his feet, fought desperately to stem the tide.
So effective were their blows that for a time
they actually succeeded in checking the advance.</p>

<p>"Oh, for a gun!" breathed Ned.</p>

<p>"A cannon!" amended Herc.</p>

<p>Above them they heard a cheer, signifying
that the first boat had struck the water.</p>

<p>"Stick it out, Herc!" panted Ned, as he
struggled with a grimy giant, who, thanks to
his ignorance of wrestling and tackles, was easily
hurled backward by his lighter opponent.
But the fight was too uneven to be of long duration.</p>

<p>Step by step, fighting every inch of the way,
the two boys were borne backward by the opposing
mob. Ned's foot caught in the lower step
of the stairway and he was toppled over backward.</p>

<p>A mighty onrush of the fugitives immediately
followed, and Herc shared Ned's fate.</p>

<p>The thought that they had failed flashed bitterly
through each Dreadnought Boy's mind as
they were trampled and crushed by hurrying
feet of the terrified firemen, whose van was followed
by the badly scared male passengers. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
screams of the women who were being ruthlessly
thrust aside tingled maddeningly in the
boys' ears as they strove to regain their feet.</p>

<p>Suddenly, above all the noise of the fugitives
and the crackling of the flames as they ate
through the bulkheads about the engine-room
hatchway, the boys heard a sharp command.</p>

<p>It rang out as incisively as the report of a
rifle, in a voice that seemed used to implicit
obedience:</p>

<p>"I'll shoot the next man up that stairway!"</p>

<p>The rush came to halt for a brief second, and
in that time the boys scrambled to their feet.</p>

<p>They soon perceived the cause of the interruption.</p>

<p>Not far from them, garbed in his shirt and
trousers, just as he had rushed from his cabin
on awaking, stood the man who had occupied the
neighboring cabin to theirs.</p>

<p>The flames illumined the grim compression of
his lips beneath his gray mustache. His eyes
were narrowed to a determined angle.</p>

<p>In his hand he held a blue-steel navy revolver
on which the glare of the conflagration played
glisteningly.</p>

<p>"Come on, boys!" roared the stoker who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
threatened Herc with the spanner. "It's just a
bluff!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i3large.jpg"><img src="images/i3.jpg" width="400" height="585" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">"That's to show you I <i>mean business</i>!"</div>
</div>

<p>At his words, the spell that had fallen on the
frightened crowd for a second seemed to be
broken, and the rush recommenced. The boys,
with horrified eyes, saw the giant stoker snatch
up a woman with a child in her arms and hurl
her brutally back into the crowd, where she disappeared,
lost in the vortex of struggling humanity.</p>

<p>"Crack!"</p>

<p>There was a spit of vicious blue flame from
the revolver, followed by a yell of pain from the
giant stoker.</p>

<p>The boys saw the spanner fall from his upraised
hand and tumble with a clatter at his feet.
His wrist, shot through by the gray-mustached
man's unerring aim, hung limp at his side.</p>

<p>Like frightened sheep suddenly checked in a
stampede, the white-faced crowd came to a halt
and faced about at the new peril.</p>

<p>"That's to show you <i>I mean business</i>!" grated
out the marksman, in a voice as cold as chilled
steel. "Now let the women go first, and then
the men may follow."</p>

<p>Under that menacing weapon, of whose efficiency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
they had just received so convincing a
proof, the men sullenly stood aside and passed
up the half-dozen women or so who had not had
an opportunity to take advantage of the boys'
plucky stand.</p>

<p>From the bridge above, the captain of the
<i>Rhode Island</i> hailed them.</p>

<p>"Six boats are away! Let the rest come!"</p>

<p>"Steady, steady!" came the sharp, commanding
voice of the man with the pistol once more,
as the score of men left began to scramble up
the stairway. "One at a time! Take it easy!"</p>

<p>Under his authoritative voice the rush changed
like magic to an orderly retreat, and in a few
minutes a seventh boat was loaded with frightened
passengers and lowered onto the heaving
sea.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we can go now, Herc," remarked
Ned, turning to his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's getting as warm here as it is in the
smoke house at home in July," agreed Herc, as
he carefully picked up his suitcase, which was
somewhat battered by the recent knocking about
it had gone through. After Ned had likewise
recovered his piece of baggage, the two boys
began the ascent of the stairway. For the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
they had quite forgotten the presence of
the gray-mustached man, of whom, as we know,
Herc stood in some awe on account of the inscription
he had espied on the former's suitcase.</p>

<p>Now, however, the stranger was at the boys'
sides. They saluted instinctively.</p>

<p>"I was a witness of your plucky conduct," he
exclaimed warmly, "and I am glad to see that I
was not to be disappointed in the estimate I had
formed of both your characters. I shall keep a
sharp lookout over your future careers as seamen
in the navy."</p>

<p>It was a moment when ordinary barriers
seemed to be let down, and Herc, in a hesitating
tone, asked, as they gained the boat deck:</p>

<p>"Are you in the navy, too, sir, may we ask?"</p>

<p>"You may, my boy," was the hearty response.
"I am Captain Dunham of the <i>Manhattan</i>."</p>

<p>"You're all right, sir," sputtered Herc, in his
enthusiasm entirely forgetting the respect due
to an officer.</p>

<p>The next minute, with cheeks even more crimson
than the flames and his exertions had painted
them, the farmer boy plunged forward into the
confusion of the boat deck, much embarrassed
at his impulsive breach of discipline.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">A COWARD'S BLOW.</p>


<p>Thanks to the boys' defense of the stairway,
and the cool-headed commander's prompt action
in quelling the onrush of the stokers, the boys
found that there was plenty of room in the two
boats that still remained to be lowered. Haste,
however, was a matter of necessity, as the flames
by this time had devoured the bulkheads and
were sweeping forward, driven by the high wind.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Rhode Island</i> had recovered
his wits, and the loading of the boats went on
rapidly. In its company were enrolled the cowardly
stokers, at whom the boys could not gaze
without a feeling of disgust.</p>

<p>"Are not you boys going in that boat?" said
a voice at their elbow, as the davits were swung
out and the remainder of the crew prepared to
lower it.</p>

<p>"No, sir; as navy men," said Ned, proudly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
dwelling on the "men," "we prefer to wait till
the last boat to leave the ship."</p>

<p>"That's right," agreed the commander approvingly.</p>

<p>He hastened off and assumed the control of the
few maneuvres to be carried out before the
<i>Rhode Island</i> was ready to be abandoned. The
captain of the <i>Rhode Island</i> had recognized Captain
Dunham, and was anxiously trying to aid
him; but the naval commander treated the other
with some contempt, doubtless inspired by the
latter's abject failure to quell the panic in its
inception or handle it when it broke.</p>

<p>The boys now had time to gaze about them.</p>

<p>The glare of the burning ship lit up the surrounding
water with a weird radiance, in which
they could see the loaded boats, already lowered,
tossing helplessly, the crowds on each being so
great that the sailors could not use their oars.</p>

<p>"Say, Ned, suppose the boiler busts!" suddenly
exclaimed the cheerful Herc, as the last boat
was swung out.</p>

<p>"No use thinking of such possibilities," rejoined
Ned decisively.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it," protested Herc indignantly.
"I remember when that thresher blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
up to grandpa's. I guess this would be something
like that, eh, Ned?"</p>

<p>"Only more so," was the dry reply.</p>

<p>Suddenly the notification that all was ready
for the lowering of the last boat rang out.</p>

<p>As this one was to be the final lifeboat to leave
the ship, it was put overside before any one
boarded it. The officers of the <i>Rhode Island</i>, the
six members of the crew remaining, the boys and
Commander Dunham getting into it by sliding
down the falls.</p>

<p>At last they were all on board, and the order
was given to shove off. No time was lost in
doing this, as the <i>Rhode Island</i> was by this
time a mass of flames in her forepart, and it
seemed impossible that she could float much
longer.</p>

<p>"Do you anticipate being picked up shortly,
captain?" asked the boys' friend of the commander
of the <i>Rhode Island</i>.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't expect that we'll have to drift
about very long," was the reply. "You see, the
Sound is well traveled, and some ship must have
seen the flare of the fire."</p>

<p>It was bitterly cold in the storm-swept waters
of the Sound, but the boys checked any tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
they might have felt to complain by thinking of
the plight of the women and children in the
other boats.</p>

<p>It is doubtful as the newspapers at the time
pointed out, that there would have been no fatalities
attendant on the wreck of the <i>Rhode Island</i>,
if but a little less than half an hour after they
had cast adrift from the ill-fated steamer, the
<i>Kentucky</i>, of the Joy Line, had not hove in
sight. By this time the <i>Rhode Island</i> had
burned to the water's edge, and sank with a noisy
roar.</p>

<p>The <i>Kentucky</i> bore down with all speed on the
drifting boatloads of half-frozen men and women,
and within an hour every one of the passengers
had been picked up and given warm food and
drink and attention.</p>

<p>As the <i>Kentucky</i>, having performed her rescue
work, pursued her way to New York, the boys
mingled with the excited crowd of the saved that
thronged her lighted saloon.</p>

<p>While they walked about, overhearing interesting
scraps of conversation relating to the rescues
of several of the passengers, they were
startled by a sudden cry in a woman's voice:</p>

<p>"There he is! There he is, the coward!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a rush to the part of the saloon
from whence the cry had proceeded. Every one
was naturally anxious to ascertain what could
have caused it. The boys were among the curious
persons who joined the throng.</p>

<p>They saw a slight, pale-faced woman pointing
indignantly to a tall youth who was slinking away
through the crowd, trying evidently to conceal
himself from the woman's scorn.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, madam?" somebody asked
the excited woman.</p>

<p>"Why, I was in the first rush for the stairway,"
explained the woman, "before those brave young
men there&mdash;&mdash;" It was the boys' turn to try to
slink away. "Before those brave young men
there kept back the cowardly fellows who were
trying to trample past us. That man yonder,
who has just slunk away, dealt me this blow in
the face," she pointed to a livid weal on her cheek,
"and knocked me down."</p>

<p>A roar of indignation went up as she related
the craven conduct of the youth the boys had
observed slink off. Some of the more excitable
passengers shouted that they wanted to organize
a party to find him and deal him out summary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
punishment. Cooler counsel prevailed, however,
and the rest of the night was passed in as comfortable
a manner as was possible on the overcrowded
ship.</p>

<p>When the <i>Kentucky</i> arrived at her dock on the
East River, below the Brooklyn Bridge, she was
met by big crowds, among whom were many
reporters, the wireless stations along the
Sound having been notified by the <i>Kentucky</i> of
the disaster that had overtaken the <i>Rhode
Island</i>.</p>

<p>The boys, laughingly turning aside the assiduous
young men of the press, were making their
way ashore, when Herc suddenly caught hold of
Ned's arm.</p>

<p>"Look there!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Ned looked, and saw Hank Harkins standing
in the midst of a throng of reporters, to whom
he was evidently giving a "big story."</p>

<p>"I took the woman in my arms," the boys heard
him say, as they paused, "and made my way to
the upper deck with her."</p>

<p>"You saved her?" asked a young reporter,
holding a long pencil poised above a very large
new notebook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I saved her, and then&mdash;&mdash;" Hank was
continuing, when his jaw suddenly dropped, and
he shook as if he was about to have a fit.</p>

<p>Then, without another word to the amazed reporters,
he shouldered his way through their
ranks and dashed off down the gangplank in the
direction of the land.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Herc. "I'll remember
Hank's look when he met our eyes as long as I
live. He looked like a dying duck in a thunderstorm!"</p>

<p>"I guess we headed off his thrilling narrative,
all right," commented Ned, echoing Herc's merriment.</p>

<p>"And for a good reason, too," went on Herc.
"I recognized Hank as he slunk away from that
woman last night. He was the coward who
struck her and disgraced his uniform."</p>

<p>"I'm glad his overcoat covered it," rejoined
Ned.</p>

<p>At this juncture one of the reporters, who had
noticed that both the lads wore Uncle Sam's uniforms,
hurried up to them.</p>

<p>"Can you tell us what was the matter with
that fellow?" he demanded. "He was just in the
middle of giving us a good story, when he suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
hurried off as if he had been shot. Is he a
reliable chap, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't believe <i>all</i> he told you,"
grinned Herc, as the Dreadnought Boys hurried
ashore, to cross New York and join their ship.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">"WE ARE PART OF THE FLEET."</p>


<p>After some little difficulty the boys ascertained
that the <i>Manhattan</i> lay up the North River, off
the foot of Seventy-second Street and Riverside
Drive. They could go to Seventy-second Street
in a subway express, they were informed, and
then walk across to the boat landing, where they
would be almost sure to find a launch from the
big Dreadnought waiting to take off the shore-leave
men.</p>

<p>"Say!" gasped Herc, as the two, having descended
into the "tube" and seated themselves in
the lighted car, were whirled northward through
pitch darkness toward their destination, "how
far does this hole in the ground go?"</p>

<p>"Almost as far as Yonkers, I guess," replied
Ned; "or so I've heard. Don't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Not much," rejoined Herc; "it's like trying
to talk in a boiler factory."</p>

<p>The two boys had their suitcases tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
clutched between their knees, but nevertheless,
when they reached the Grand Central station, the
inrush of passengers, tumbling and pushing like
mad to get seats, swept the lads' possessions before
them as if the two pieces of baggage had
been chaff in a high wind.</p>

<p>"Hey! come back with those gripsacks!" yelled
Herc indignantly, seizing the arm of a puny-looking
lad who was stumbling forward over the
red-headed lad's particular possession. "Haven't
you any manners?"</p>

<p>The town-bred lad turned a sharp, ferret-eyed
face on the young sailor.</p>

<p>"Say, greenie, where do you come from,
Painted Post or far Cohoes 'where the wind
flower blows'? Just keep an eye on your own
junk, or else hire an express wagon."</p>

<p>The indignant Herc stooped to rescue his suitcase,
and by the time he raised a red and angry
face, the sharp-faced lad had gone.</p>

<p>"Good thing he did get out of the way, or I'd
have fetched him a clip on the ear!" grumbled
Herc, as he resumed his seat by Ned, who had
by this time retrieved his property also.</p>

<p>"No use losing your temper," counseled Ned;
"just keep cool. Hullo, there is an old lady and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
a younger one standing up over there. The old
one looks feeble. I'm going to give them these
seats. Come on and get up."</p>

<p>"All right," muttered Herc, "but I don't see
any one else doing so. See, all the men are seated
and the women all seem to be standing up.
What's the use of being different to the others?
We'll only get stared at."</p>

<p>"All the more reason that we should be polite.
The first duty of a sailor is to be kind and courteous
to those weaker than himself," rejoined Ned
in an undertone, as the boys rose to their feet.</p>

<p>With a courteous bow, Ned approached the
ladies and motioned behind him to where he supposed
two seats were vacant.</p>

<p>"Will you avail yourself of our places,
madam?" he said, addressing the older lady and
removing his navy cap.</p>

<p>Herc, with an awkward grin, also uncovered
his red thatch and made a sweeping motion behind
him with his big hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, sir," rejoined the elderly
lady, "my daughter and myself would be
very glad to accept your kindness, but others
seem already to have availed themselves of it."</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Ned, wheeling, with a red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
face, and clapping his eyes on the seats they had
just vacated.</p>

<p>Sure enough, as the elderly lady had said, they
were occupied.</p>

<p>Two stout, red-faced men, with well-rounded
stomachs and fingers covered with diamonds,
lolled at their ease in the just vacated seats, reading
their papers. They had slipped into the places
while the boys were requesting the two ladies to
take them.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know about that?" sputtered
Herc indignantly. "They just sneaked into
those seats like skunks into a wood pile."</p>

<p>"They'll come out of them a lot more easily,"
breathed Ned grimly, as he took in the situation.</p>

<p>Bending forward, he addressed the interlopers
courteously enough, while those around who had
witnessed the scene looked on curiously. It is
not often that a subway passenger has the courage
to resent any slight, however marked. From
the compression of Ned's lips and the determined
flash in his eyes, however, it was evident that he
had no intention of allowing the two beefy newspaper
readers to enjoy their stolen seats undisturbed.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Ned. "Perhaps you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
are not aware that my friend and I vacated those
seats to allow these ladies to be seated."</p>

<p>One of the red-faced ones, slightly older, it
seemed, than the other, looked up with a bovine
stare in his heavily rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>He stared at the Dreadnought Boys much as if
they had been some strange visitors from another
planet.</p>

<p>"I guess you don't know much about Noo
Yawk," he said in a sneering tone, "or you'd have
known that in the Subway it's 'first come, first
served.'"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" inquired Ned, keeping down his
anger, while Herc was dancing about in the narrow
space he could find in the aisle of the crowded
car. The red-headed lad was biting his nails and
scratching his head in a manner that boded a
storm as surely as black clouds portend thunder.</p>

<p>"That being the case," Ned went on in a cool
voice, "it's about time that the Subway learned a
few manners. We gave those seats up for those
two ladies, and not for you. Are you going to
vacate them?"</p>

<p>"Aw, run along and roll your hoop!" sneered
the younger newspaper reader, with an affectation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of great languor. "You drunken sailors
make me tired."</p>

<p>A brown hand shot out as the words left his
lips, and the beefy one found himself propelled
by the shoulder into the center of the car faster
than he had had occasion to move for a long time.</p>

<p>At the same instant Herc, to his huge delight,
perceived the signal for action and sailed in on
his man. In another second the two beefy ones,
dazed by the suddenness of it all, stood side by
side in the center of the car, while Ned courteously
aided the two ladies to the seats from which
the interlopers had been so suddenly wrenched.</p>

<p>"This is an outrage!" bellowed the red-faced
men in concert, as they found their voices. "Such
a thing has never happened before."</p>

<p>"That's a pity," observed Ned contemptuously,
while the delighted Herc whispered in a stage
undertone:</p>

<p>"Mine came out like a soft, white worm out of
a hickory nut."</p>

<p>"Conductor! conductor!" howled the man to
whom Ned had given such a rough and ready lesson
in manners, "come here and do your duty.
We've been assaulted."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The conductor pushed his way through the
crowded aisle, assuming an air of great importance.</p>

<p>"What's all this? What's all this?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"These two rowdy sailors deprived us of our
seats," sputtered one of the red-faced men.</p>

<p>"Did you fellows do what he says?" demanded
the conductor importantly.</p>

<p>"Sure they did. They pulled the gentlemen
right out of them," piped up a voice in the background
of the crowd&mdash;that of the ferret-faced
youth.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen!" snorted Herc. "We'd call 'em
hogs up our way!"</p>

<p>"We got up to give our seats to those two
ladies, and are very sorry to have caused them
this embarrassment," volunteered Ned. "But to
see these two overfed fellows slip into the seats
before we had hardly risen from them got our
dander riz, and we undertook to put them out."</p>

<p>"Conductor, you will call a special policeman at
the next station," shouted the man that Ned had
hauled to his feet. "I'll make a charge against
these desperate ruffians. They need a lesson."</p>

<p>Ned and Herc exchanged alarmed glances.</p>

<p>It might ruin their naval careers if, on the eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of joining their ship, they were to undergo the
disgrace of an arrest.</p>

<p>"Better think it over," advised the conductor,
who seemed disposed to make peace, and as he
slipped by the boys, to regain his platform as the
train slackened speed, he whispered:</p>

<p>"You'd best make a sneak, boys; that fellow
is Dave Pulsifer, the big gun man, and the other's
his brother. He's got lots of influence, and
he means to make trouble for you."</p>

<p>Little as either of the Dreadnought Boys relished
the idea of running away from trouble, yet
the advice seemed good. They both knew enough
of the law's delays to realize that, in the event of
their being arrested on the red-faced man's
charge, they would be liable to be held for some
time before they could have chance of explaining
the circumstances of the case to a magistrate.</p>

<p>As the train rolled into the Seventy-second
Street station, therefore, they adroitly slipped by
their friend, the conductor, and, as soon as he
opened the door, shot out onto the platform.</p>

<p>The red-faced men, crying loudly for a special
policeman, were in the act of following them,
when&mdash;quite by accident, it seemed&mdash;the conductor's
foot got in the way, and the first of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
pair of worthies fell headlong over it, and his
companion, who was pressing hard on his heels,
piled on top of him.</p>

<p>By the time they had extricated themselves,
during which period the crowd of passengers behind
them, who were also anxious to alight, went
almost crazy at having to wait a few seconds, the
two lads were far down the sidewalks of Seventy-second
Street. After a few minutes' brisk walk
they reached the snow-covered slopes of Riverside
Drive.</p>

<p>"Pulsifer! I know that name," Ned mused, as
they hurried along. "I have it!" he exclaimed
suddenly. "He's Dave Pulsifer, of Pulsifer
Bros., the fellows who make guns in America and
sell them to foreign governments."</p>

<p>"I'll bet those two were the brothers, then,"
suggested Herc. "They looked like two ugly
pups of the same homely litter."</p>

<p>The boys gave the matter little more thought,
though had they realized how intimately the Pulsifers
were to be associated with their further
career, they might have considered their encounter
more seriously.</p>

<p>"Look, Herc, look!" cried Ned, as they came in
sight of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>From the slight eminence on which they
stood, the boys commanded a magnificent spectacle.</p>

<p>Up and down the majestic stream, as far as the
eye could reach, the grim, slaty-hued forms of
Uncle Sam's sea bulldogs swung at anchor.</p>

<p>From the funnels of some smoke was lazily
floating, while others lay like sleeping monsters
on the surface of the dark river.</p>

<p>Looking northward, the boys saw only a maze
of cage masts&mdash;looking not unlike narrow waste-paper
baskets turned upside down&mdash;and great
dark hulls. Here and there a gaily-colored bit of
bunting, which as yet meant little to the boys,
fluttered from a masthead or from the signal halliards.
Between the ships and the shore constantly
darted light gasoline boats, or swift
launches with big gray hoods over them.</p>

<p>"Just think, Herc, <i>we</i> are a part of all that!"
breathed Ned reverently almost, indicating the
formidable array of fighting craft with a wave
of his hand.</p>

<p>"Gee! I feel about as big as an ant," whispered
Herc, even his irrepressible nature overawed at
the sight. "How in the world are we&mdash;little, insignificant
specks&mdash;ever going to distinguish ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
in all that big array of fighting ships and
fighting men?"</p>

<p>"We must do our best, Herc," rejoined Ned
simply. "And now let's be getting down to that
landing place. I think I see some man-o'-war
launches landing there. Maybe we will be lucky
enough to find one of the <i>Manhattan's</i> boats."</p>

<p>As they started down an inclined road which
led through the park and across the railroad
tracks at its foot, they were accosted by a hearty
voice just astern of them.</p>

<p>"Hullo, there, shipmates!" it hailed. "Where
away?"</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys wheeled, and found
themselves facing an elderly man, somewhat inclined
to stoutness, but whose grizzled and
weather-beaten face bore the true trademarks of
an old man-o'-war Jack upon it.</p>

<p>"Why, you're from the <i>Manhattan</i>!" cried
Ned, as his eyes fell on the other's name band,
on which the name of the new Dreadnought was
embroidered in gilt thread.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, my hearties," was the rejoinder in
a voice cracked with much shouting in heavy
weather in all climes, "and you are a pair of
rookies&mdash;land-lubbers, eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I guess you might call us that," responded
Ned, not best pleased at this free and
easy mode of address, but judging it best to be
as amiable as possible. "Can you tell us how to
get aboard the <i>Manhattan</i>? We've just left the
Naval Training School and are appointed to her."</p>

<p>"Get your rating?"</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;ordinary seamen."</p>

<p>"That's good. Come on with me, boys, and
I'll put you aboard ship shape and comfortable.
It's a cold day when old Tom Marlin can't look
out for a pair of greenies."</p>

<p>Piloted by their companion, the two boys soon
arrived at the landing place, which was already
crowded with sailors whose shore leave had expired.</p>

<p>"Which is the <i>Manhattan</i>?" asked Sam, gazing
with eyes that were still awestruck at the immense
vessels that lay out in the river and appeared
several sizes too large for their mooring places.</p>

<p>"Right yonder, Bricktop," rejoined old Tom,
pointing off to a vessel which, large as were the
other battleships, seemed by her huge size almost
to dwarf them. "That's the old hooker. The
last output of your old Uncle Sam. Right in the
next berth to her is the <i>Idaho</i>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that red flag, with a black ball in the
center, floating from the <i>Idaho's</i> main?" inquired
Ned, much interested.</p>

<p>"That? Oh, that's the meat-ball!" laughed old
Tom.</p>

<p>"The meat-ball?" echoed the boys, much astonished.</p>

<p>"A sort of dinner flag, I suppose?" asked Herc,
who was beginning to feel hungry.</p>

<p>"Not much, my lad," laughed the old sailor.
"That's the gunnery pennant for the vessel making
the best score at the targets. The <i>Idaho</i> won
that off the Virginia capes on our last battle practice
cruise. All the fleet's after it now, but if
we have our way, the old <i>Manhattan</i> will be flying
it after we get through peppering the marks
off Guantanamo."</p>

<p>Each of the Dreadnought Boys found himself
making up his mind, as old Tom spoke, that if it
depended on them, the <i>Manhattan</i> would be the
battleship to fly the coveted "meat-ball" when
next the fleet made port.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC TAKES A COLD BATH.</p>


<p>A few minutes after the boys' arrival at the
landing, a launch with a lead-covered hood was
seen approaching, towing three large ship's boats
behind it. The latter were crowded with jackies
coming ashore.</p>

<p>A gilt "M." on the bow of the launch proclaimed
it to be from the <i>Manhattan</i>, and Herc
made a dive for the float as the "steamer" puffed
up to the landing stage.</p>

<p>"Come on, Ned!" he cried. "Whoop! Here's
where we join the ship! Bang! Big guns! Blow
'em up! Hurray!"</p>

<p>But to Herc's surprise, as he made for the inclined
runway leading to the float, he was met
by the menacing muzzle of a rifle.</p>

<p>The weapon was held by a marine&mdash;"soldier
and sailor too"&mdash;behind whom stood the natty
middie in charge of the float.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stand back!" ordered the marine sternly.</p>

<p>Herc regarded the leveled rifle with some apprehension
and gave way a few steps to the rear.</p>

<p>"Don't you know enough not to try to embark
till the order is given?" asked Ned, as the young
midshipman scowled at the red-headed youth as if
the latter had committed some heinous crime.</p>

<p>"Why, the boats are made to get into, aren't
they?" protested Herc. "And who is that fellow
in the funny uniform, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"That's a marine," laughed Ned. "He's on
sentry duty."</p>

<p>"Oh, so he's a marine, eh?" rejoined Herc, regarding
the sentry with much disapproval. "One
of those sea soldiers&mdash;a sort of half-and-half fellow."</p>

<p>Further comment on Herc's part was cut short
by the outpouring of the laughing, shouting
jackies who were coming ashore on leave. They
poured up the narrow gangway in a seemingly
never-ending stream.</p>

<p>"There'll be no one left to man the ships,"
gasped Herc, as the ranks of light-hearted shore-leave
men poured past. Some of them carried
suitcases, and were evidently going ashore to bid
a last good-by to their friends. Others, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
folks probably resided in distant cities, were going
ashore for a last look at New York.</p>

<p>"Those fellows will all have to be on board by
midnight," explained old Tom to the boys.
"They're going to crowd all they can into the
few hours they'll have ashore."</p>

<p>"Then we are to sail soon?" inquired Ned, his
heart beating high and his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"Before eight bells to-morrow morning we'll
be in the Narrows," rejoined the old bluejacket.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" cried Ned, gazing at the
ranks of bronzed, healthy faces which were still
passing by.</p>

<p>"Want action, eh?" laughed old Tom. "Well,
lads, you'll get it before you are many hours
older; and remember, my lad, that it isn't all fun
aboard a man-o'-war, and always bear in mind
one thing&mdash;do what you're told without grumbling.
Tee-total abstinence, when it comes to
making remarks about what you are told to do in
Uncle Sam's navy."</p>

<p>"Say, Ned," whispered Herc.</p>

<p>"What?" asked Ned, still engrossed in the animated
scene before him, and in the formidable
background formed by the motionless war machines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, did you hear what he said?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing; only it looks as if we had bitten
off more than we could chew, that's all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I didn't like that part about 'not grumbling
whatever we are told to do.' It looks as
if we might have some pretty tough chores set
us."</p>

<p>"I guess we shall have all sorts of chores,"
laughed Ned, as he regarded Herc's rueful face;
"but we didn't enlist to look pretty and pose becomingly
in our uniforms. We're in the United
States navy for four years, and whatever happens,
we've got to stick to it."</p>

<p>The lads' conversation had been carried on in
an undertone, but Ned had unconsciously raised
his voice as he spoke the last words.</p>

<p>"That's the talk, shipmate," said old Tom, regarding
him approvingly. "I never heard a boy
talking like that yet who didn't come out of the
big end of the horn before he'd served out his
enlistment. The navy's the finest place in the
world for boys of your cut, but it's no place for
shirkers."</p>

<p>The old man regarded Herc as he spoke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the carroty-headed boy's eyes fell under the tar's
keen, half-humorous gaze. To tell the truth, Herc
was beginning to half regret that he had enlisted
at all. The prospect of four years' service at the
hard tasks at which the old sailor had hinted did
not best please him; but Herc knew better than to
make any complaint to Ned. The other lad, however,
had noticed his companion's downcast looks
and rallied him on them.</p>

<p>"Come, Herc, cheer up!" he said heartily.
"We're like young bears&mdash;all our troubles before
us; but they'll lick us into shape, never fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, crickey! there you go again," groaned
Herc.</p>

<p>"Go again&mdash;what?" demanded Ned, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Why, talking about 'licking us.' Do they still
lick fellows in the navy, Mr. Tom?"</p>

<p>"No, my lad; the cat-o'-nine-tails was abolished
in Uncle Sam's ships years ago," responded the
old man, with a twinkle; "but we've still got the
brig."</p>

<p>"The brig&mdash;that's a kind of a ship, isn't it?"
inquired Ned.</p>

<p>"Not as I knows of," grinned old Tom; "but
teetotal abstinence is the word when it comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the brig, my lads. I hope you'll never form its
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Attention!"</p>

<p>The young midshipman shouted the order.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys straightened up, as did
all the other tars. The landing parties had by
this time all dispersed and were straggling up the
hill, playing all manner of tricks on each other,
more like a lot of happy boys just out of school
than anything else.</p>

<p>"Now, what's that young whipper-snapper going
to do?" whispered Herc.</p>

<p>"Hush!" rejoined Ned. "I expect we are going
to get an order."</p>

<p>He was right.</p>

<p>Orders were given for the men to board the
boats in a quiet, orderly manner.</p>

<p>"Keep close by me," cautioned old Tom, "and
never mind the joshing you are going to get."</p>

<p>Ned had noticed for the past few minutes that
the sailors assembled on the wharf had been eyeing
them curiously, and that some of them had
been whispering together.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the trouble?" asked Herc.</p>

<p>"I expect the boys will give you a bit of a hazing,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
replied old Tom. "But take it all in good
part, and you'll soon be shipmates with all of
them."</p>

<p>The old sailor's prophecy came true.</p>

<p>The midshipman who had been on duty at the
float was relieved by another of his rank, and the
first then took his place in the "steamer" which
was to tow the boats full of jackies. As he sat
in the stern sheets of the power craft, he could
not see readily what was going on in the boats,
and perhaps made it a point not to be too observant.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc found themselves in the second
boat, and as they had become separated from old
Tom in the rush to board the craft, they had now
no mentor to advise them, and felt curiously alone
among the laughing, joking bluejackets that
crowded the boats to the gunwales.</p>

<p>"I see the old man's ordered his winter's supply
of kindling!" came in a loud stage whisper
from the boat in which the two lads were seated.</p>

<p>The "old man" always refers to the commander
of a man-of-war, in the parlance of the jackies.</p>

<p>"Say, Bill, your thatch is on fire!" laughed another.</p>

<p>Poor Herc felt his cheeks turn as red as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
unlucky hair under the running fire of banter
which, there was no room to doubt, was intended
for him.</p>

<p>"Might be a good thing to call fire stations,"
grinned another. "I don't much like the idea of
sailing on a battleship with so much combustible
stuff aboard."</p>

<p>"Like being shipmates with a red-hot stove,"
put in another before-the-mast humorist.</p>

<p>"Keep cool, Herc," whispered Ned, who was
beginning to dread an outburst on the part of his
impulsive companion.</p>

<p>Unfortunately his whisper was overheard, and
a shout went up from those nearest the two boys.</p>

<p>"That's right! 'Keep cool, Herc!'" they mimicked.
"Don't get afire, mate, or we may have
to duck you."</p>

<p>"I reckon he must have belonged to the village
fire department," put in another.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they practiced putting out fires on his
head," came another voice.</p>

<p>It was more than flesh and blood could bear.</p>

<p>Herc arose angrily to his feet, and was beginning
a speech full of hot resentment, when the
boat, which was by this time under way, gave a
sudden lurch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>Herc had been unmindful of the fact that a
fresh wind blowing up the North River kicks up
quite a sea, and in a second he was sprawling on
the bottom of the boat, with a perfect tempest of
laughter ringing in his burning ears.</p>

<p>But, as he fell, Herc's heavy form careened
against a seaman who was standing upright,
scanning the vessel they were approaching.
Down crashed the two, with Herc on top. When
they rose the nose of the seaman who had fallen
under Here's bulky person was bloody, and his
eyes inflamed with rage.</p>

<p>"You hayseed-eating swab," he growled, "look
here&mdash;blood all over my blouse. Now I've got to
clean it or get a call down."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," said Herc penitently, "I
didn't do it on purpose."</p>

<p>"You're a liar, and I'll trim you for it before
long."</p>

<p>Herc recollected Ned's advice, and bottled his
rage. In a cutting voice, however, he rejoined:</p>

<p>"At the Training School they told us that most
sailors were gentlemen. I guess they were dead
wrong."</p>

<p>"Fire's out!" yelled somebody; but as, by this
time, they were almost alongside the towering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
slate-colored sides of the <i>Manhattan</i>, a quick cry
of "Hush!" ran through the boat, and the Dreadnought
Boys, for the present, escaped further
trials of their tempers.</p>

<p>"Aren't we going to board the ship?" asked
Herc, as the launch approached the <i>Manhattan</i>,
which was swung up-stream, with the tide.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Ned.</p>

<p>Both lads spoke in an undertone, so as not to
run the risk of incurring a rebuke or the bringing
down of further teasing on their heads.</p>

<p>"But there is a gangway hanging over the side
right there," objected Herc, pointing to a substantial
stairway leading from the stern structure
of the big war vessel to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"Why, you lubber," laughed Ned, "that's the
officer's landing place. We are not allowed to
land on the starboard side. We jackies have to
go round to the port side of the ship."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked Herc, in whose mind a
very distinct feeling that he should not like the
navy was beginning to take shape.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the launch drew up at the
officer's gangway, and the young midshipman
leaped in an agile manner onto it. The launch
then continued round the steep bow of the <i>Manhattan</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
which towered like a mighty cliff of gray
steel above the boys' heads. It steamed on till it
arrived beneath a number of "Jacob's ladders"
dangling from booms projecting several feet outward
from the vessel's side.</p>

<p>"How on earth do we get aboard?" said Herc.</p>

<p>"Climb up those ladders," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>"What, those swinging things?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then we run along those booms till we are
on board the ship."</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>Herc looked apprehensively at the swinging
ladders up which the jackies from the first boat
were already beginning to swarm like monkeys,
nimbly scampering along the booms when they
reached the top. They steadied themselves on the
lofty perches by light hand-lines rigged for the
purpose.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Surely you are not getting
scared?"</p>

<p>"No, not scared," replied Herc. "But what's a
fellow want to come into the navy for if he can
make a living walking a tight rope?"</p>

<p>"Come on, you two rookies!" shouted a voice at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
this moment. "Let's see how you can manage a
Jacob's ladder."</p>

<p>There was a taunting note in the words that
made Ned wheel angrily. He saw facing him,
with an ugly leer on his countenance, the hulking-looking
man, whose arm stripes denoted that he
was serving his second enlistment, with whom
Herc had already had the recorded passage-at-arms.
Then and there Ned felt that this fellow
and himself were not destined to make good shipmates.
He also determined, however, not to let
any of the jackies see that there was an instant's
hesitation in his mind about taking the perilous-looking
climb.</p>

<p>"Come on, Herc," he cried, as he made a spring
for the ladder.</p>

<p>Its swaying end hung a good three feet above
the boat, and as the river was fairly choppy, the
craft, heavy as it was, bobbed about in a lively
manner. The lad's experience at the training
school, however, had taught him not to mind this,
and without an instant's pause he made a jump
for the contrivance, and a second later was climbing
up it like a squirrel.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll wait and see after our baggage,"
called Herc after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your baggage will be sent up afterward by
deep-sea express, bricktop!" yelled a derisive
voice. "Come on, now, get up that ladder lively,
and don't keep us waiting."</p>

<p>Poor Herc, with much inward perturbation,
made a jump for the ladder, and, to his surprise,
found that it was easier than he had expected to
negotiate. He scrambled rapidly upward after
Ned, who by this time was almost at the boom.</p>

<p>Close behind Herc came the sailor who had
taunted the boys in the boat. His name was
Ralph Kennell, otherwise known as "Kid" Kennell.
He had quite a reputation in the fleet as a
fighter and wrestler, and on the strength of his
renown had allowed a naturally domineering disposition
to develop into that of a full-fledged
bully.</p>

<p>Kennell pressed close behind Herc as the red-headed
boy clambered as fast as he could toward
the boom.</p>

<p>"The sooner it's over, the better," thought poor
Herc to himself, as he made his best pace upward.</p>

<p>But it was no part of Kennell's plans that the
Dreadnought Boys should make their first appearance
on board the <i>Manhattan</i> without some
sort of an accident befalling them, and he did his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
best to "rattle" Herc as he climbed close on his
heels.</p>

<p>Already Ned had gained the boom, and scampered
neatly along it and alighted on the white
deck of the first battleship he had ever boarded.
He gazed anxiously over the rail at poor Herc as
he toiled upward. Ned's quick eyes did not escape
the fact that Kennell was "bullyragging" Herc to
the extent of his capacity in this direction, which
was considerable.</p>

<p>The cheeks of Herc's chum burned angrily as
he gazed, but he was powerless to interfere. The
officer of the deck, with his telescope tucked under
his arm, was standing near by, and Ned knew it
would be a gross infraction of navy discipline to
shout the warning he longed to deliver to Herc.
Ned had, as soon as he reached the deck, turned
toward the stern and saluted the flag, and then
paid the same compliment to the officer, who had
touched the rim of his cap in return.</p>

<p>And now Herc had scrambled up onto the
boom, which was slightly flattened on the top and
not really so very difficult of passage. He started
along it, gripping the frail hand-line tightly. It
is likely that, if he had been left alone, he would
have gained the ship without disaster, but Kennell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
was close behind him, and as Herc, with set face
and white cheeks, reached the center of the narrow
"bridge," the ship's bully closed up on him.</p>

<p>What happened then occurred so quickly that
the jackies who watched it said afterward that
all they saw was Herc's body shooting downward
with a despairing cry, and a second later
another flash, as his chum's form dashed through
the air and entered the water close by the place
of Herc's disappearance with a loud splash.</p>

<p>Instantly the startling cry of "Man overboard!"
echoed from mouth to mouth along the
decks of the Dreadnought.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A NAVAL INITIATION.</p>


<p>Both the Dreadnought Boys were good swimmers.
Even if they had not been drilled in this
art at the training school, their experiences in
the old swimming pool at home would have made
them at home in the water. Ned had dived after
his chum as a matter of impulse, more than anything
else, and, a second after the two splashes
had resounded, both boys appeared on the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>A few strokes brought them to the side of the
ship, where they clung to the slight projection afforded
by an out-board seacock, till a ladder came
snaking down to them.</p>

<p>By this time the rail, which seemed to be as
high above them as the summit of a skyscraper,
was lined with faces, and at the stern the officers
who were on board were peering over the side of
the quarterdeck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Dunham himself, summoned by his orderly,
came running from his cabin, as the two
dripping youths arose from their immersion, and
joined his officers on the stern. He had just come
on board in his own launch.</p>

<p>"Who are they, Scott?" he asked of his executive
officer, as the boys once more ascended the
side of the ship on the emergency ladder.</p>

<p>"Two recruits, sir, from the training station,
I believe, sir," was the reply, with a salute.</p>

<p>"Well, they are certainly taking a naval baptism,"
laughed the captain, whose merriment was
echoed by his officers, now that it was seen the
boys were safe, "but how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. I was not forward at the
time," was the rejoinder. "The shore men were
coming on board, I believe, and the red-headed
young fellow fell from the boom. His companion
dived instantly after him. It was a plucky
act, sir."</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked the captain. "I suppose
it was an accident, and we can take no official
notice of it. By the way, Scott, those two young
men, I perceive now, are the ones I spoke to you
about as having behaved with such singular courage
and cool-headedness when the <i>Rhode Island</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
burned. Keep an eye on them, for I think they
have the makings of real sailors in them."</p>

<p>"I shall, sir," replied the executive officer, saluting,
as the captain turned away with a return of
the courtesy.</p>

<p>If Ned and Herc were wet and cold without,
they were warm enough within as they gained
the deck. Ned's eye had detected Kennell's foot
in the act of reaching out to trip his chum and
cousin, and he felt within him an overpowering
desire to seek the man out and demand an explanation.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, for himself, other matters
occupied his attention at that moment.</p>

<p>Dripping wet as they were, the boys did not
forget their carefully instilled training, and each
came to attention and saluted as they faced the
officer of the deck.</p>

<p>"Who are you men?" demanded that dignitary,
red tape not allowing him to comment on the accident.</p>

<p>"Recruits, s-s-sir, from Newport T-T-T-Training
School," answered Ned respectfully, his teeth
chattering.</p>

<p>"Get on dry clothes and report to the master-at-arms.
Messenger!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>A messenger slid to the officer's side with a
hand raised in salute.</p>

<p>"Show these recruits to their quarters. Let
them get on dry clothes and then conduct them to
the master-at-arms."</p>

<p>As the boys' suitcases had by this time been
hoisted on board, they soon changed into dry uniforms
in the men's quarters forward, and their
conductor then beckoned them to follow him.
The two boys, their eyes round with astonishment
at the sights and scenes about them, followed
without a word, and were led through labyrinths
of steel-walled passages, down steel ladders with
glistening steel hand rails, up more ladders, and
through bulkhead doors made to open and close
with ponderous machinery. The lower decks of
the ship were lighted with hundreds of incandescent
bulbs, as, in a modern man-of-war, there
are no portholes on the sides, owing to the thickness
of the armorplate. The officers' cabins are
lighted by lozenges of glass let into the deck.</p>

<p>"It's like living in a fire-proof safe," whispered
Herc.</p>

<p>The boys noticed that, although they seemed
to be in a steel-walled maze, that the air was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
fresh and cool, and they discovered afterward
that large quantities of fresh ozone were distributed
into every part of the ship by electric blowers.
For the present, however, they followed
their guide in a sort of semi-stupefaction at the
novelty of their surroundings.</p>

<p>"Say, we must have walked a mile," gasped
Herc, as their guide finally emerged into a narrow
passage seemingly in the stern of the vessel.
He paused before a door hung with heavy curtains
and knocked.</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded a voice from inside.
"A voice as pleasant as an explosion of dynamite,"
Herc described it afterward.</p>

<p>"Two recruits, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Send them in."</p>

<p>The boys found themselves in the presence of
the master-at-arms, a dignified and business-like
officer.</p>

<p>"Your papers?" he demanded, without further
parley.</p>

<p>"Here, sir," answered both boys, producing
their precious certificates from the training
school.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms glanced over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"You seem to have good records," he remarked,
"but don't presume on them. You have
a lot to learn. Messenger!"</p>

<p>The messenger sprang to attention and saluted,
and the boys, not to be outdone in politeness, did
likewise.</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Take these two recruits to the ship's writer,
and have him enter them in the ship's records."</p>

<p>Once more the threading of the metal labyrinth
began, and the boys felt almost ready to drop as
they were ushered into another cabin, where sat
a man not unlike the master-at-arms in appearance,
but who wore spectacles perched on his
nose.</p>

<p>He took the boys' papers without a word and
filed them away in a pigeonhole. He then produced
two varnished ditty boxes, with their keys,
which he handed to the boys.</p>

<p>"These are your ditty boxes," he remarked,
handing over the caskets, which were about a
foot and a half square, neatly varnished and finished,
and each of which bore a number.</p>

<p>"You are to keep your valuables, stationery
and knicknacks of any kind in these," he said.
"Be careful of them and look after them well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about our money, sir?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"You can place that in the ship's savings bank
if you wish. It gives four per cent. Or, if you
prefer, you can deposit it with the ship's paymaster,
and draw on it as you require. If you
are transferred to another ship, it will be transferred
for you."</p>

<p>"I think the savings bank would be best," said
Ned, looking at Herc.</p>

<p>"Same here," replied the farmboy; "gran'pa
used to say, 'put your money in hogs,' but I guess
we couldn't do that aboard ship, so it's the savings
banks for me, too."</p>

<p>"Very well; you may leave your money with
me and I will give you a passbook. You see, we
do these things much as they are done ashore."</p>

<p>"I see," nodded Ned as he took his passbook,
and Herc did the same, "what do we do now,
sir?"</p>

<p>"You will now be conducted to the boatswain's
mate, who is a sort of foster-parent to young recruits,
and from him you will get the numbers
of your hammocks and be assigned to a place at
mess. He will also outline your duties to you.</p>

<p>"Messenger!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more the messenger came to salute, and
stiffened in the attitude of attention, and the boys
did the same.</p>

<p>"Conduct these recruits to the chief boatswain's
mate."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Off again," whispered Herc, as the messenger
once more darted off with the boys in tow.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">NED HOLDS HIS COUNSEL.</p>


<p>The chief boatswain's mate was a far more
awe-inspiring officer, in the boys' eyes, than any
they had so far met. They both knew enough
of the navy to realize that he and his subordinate
were the class of petty officer with whom
they would come most in contact during their
early period of enlistment.</p>

<p>This dignitary on the <i>Manhattan</i> was a fierce-looking
personage, but the boys were to learn
that as the sailors say, his "bark was worse than
his bite."</p>

<p>"Hum, recruits," he said as he looked the two
boys over.</p>

<p>"He certainly is giving us a sizing-up," whispered
Herc.</p>

<p>The ears of the boatswain's mate were sharper
than the boys had imagined.</p>

<p>"Yes, I <i>am</i> sizing you up," he said with emphasis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
"I'm thinking that you look like pretty
good material."</p>

<p>"We mean to do our best, sir," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>"That's right. That sort of ambition will
carry you far. But are you not the two boys who
fell overboard a short time ago?"</p>

<p>"I fell, and he jumped after me," corrected
Herc.</p>

<p>"How did it happen? An accident, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly an accident," rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>"What then? You mean it was done on purpose?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"We would prefer not to say now, sir," replied
Ned in the same repressed tone.</p>

<p>"You mean you intend to attend to the matter
in your own way?"</p>

<p>"Something like that," admitted Ned.</p>

<p>The officer looked sharply at him.</p>

<p>"It is my duty to warn you, my lad, that all
such matters should be confided to your superior
officer, and you should abide by his advice. However,
unless you commit some breach of discipline,
I have no concern in the affair. I must tell
you, however, that I heard from some of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
that Kennell had something to do with it. Is he
the man you suspect of causing the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I had rather not say," rejoined Ned quietly.</p>

<p>"Very well, as you wish it; only recollect what
I have told you. Now, follow me, and we will
look over your quarters. Of course, you are familiar
with hammock-slinging, and all that appertains
to it?"</p>

<p>Herc rubbed his head with a grin.</p>

<p>"I've got some bumps here yet that serve to remind
me of my first efforts to climb into one."</p>

<p>"Answer me 'yes' or 'no,' please; do not try
to say anything more."</p>

<p>"I was just explaining," muttered Herc, not
heeding Ned's warning look.</p>

<p>They were soon assigned two places, side by
side, in which they might sling their hammocks.
The space devoted to the jackies' sleeping quarters
was well forward under the superstructure
and lighted by electric lights. It was well ventilated,
and aisles of steel pillars ran in every direction.
From these the hammocks were slung.</p>

<p>"I will now show you something of the ship,
so that you may be familiar with your floating
home," said the boatswain's mate; "follow
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish he'd show us some supper," whispered
Herc. "I'm about as empty as a dry well."</p>

<p>"Never mind," rejoined Ned; "we shall soon
be summoned to eat, I expect."</p>

<p>The boatswain's mate took them through much
the same maze of steel-walled passages and heavy
doors as had the messenger. After descending
three decks and traversing the stern of the ship,
they were shown the mighty tiller and the mechanical
apparatus connecting with the wheel-house,
where the steam-steering gear was installed.
Then they were hurried along forward.
Not, however, before the officer had shown them
the emergency steam-steering gear, far below the
water-line, which could be used in case a shot disabled
the guiding apparatus above decks.</p>

<p>Forward they were conducted up steel steps
onto the gun deck, and thence to a passage under
the bridge and chart room, from which they emerged
onto the edge of a sort of steel "well,"
sunk immediately below the center of the
bridge.</p>

<p>"There are the fire-controls," said the officer,
pointing down into the "well" at a lot of shapeless
apparatus swathed in heavy, waterproof
cloth. "We keep the range-finders and other apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
covered while we are in port or in a damp
climate."</p>

<p>"The fire-controls?" echoed Herc, with half a
suspicion that his unfortunate head was coming
in as the subject of more joking. But it was not,
as the next remark of the boatswain's mate
showed him.</p>

<p>"The gunnery officer is seated in that well,
with two orderlies, at battle practice, or in actual
warfare," he explained. "He is screened there
from the enemy's fire; but, through narrow slits
cut in the steel, he sees what is going on about
him, and telegraphs the range and directs the
fire. His commands are transmitted to the gun-control
room electrically, and thence to the turrets."</p>

<p>The boys listened with deep interest.</p>

<p>"We will now go below again and look at the
gun-control room," said the boatswain's mate, as
he trotted off once more.</p>

<p>"He must be made of the same material as the
ship," groaned Herc, as the two boys followed
him.</p>

<p>As before, they traversed innumerable passages,
passing several officers on the way, whom
they, of course, saluted. In each case the salutation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
was returned by a brief touch of the officer's
fingers to his cap rim.</p>

<p>"If you'd ever get lost here, you could wander
round for a week without finding your way out,"
grumbled Herc.</p>

<p>"Not much chance," laughed their guide;
"every part of the ship, huge as it is, is visited
at least once a day by some officer. Not a corner
is allowed to escape notice."</p>

<p>Suddenly the boatswain's mate plunged downward
through a very narrow square opening,
which seemed almost too small to admit his
body.</p>

<p>The boys followed, though for a moment they
had been quite startled at his sudden disappearance.</p>

<p>"This is a part of the ship no stout man can
ever hope to penetrate," said their guide, as he
clambered down a steel ladder, which the opening,
through which he had crawled, led to.</p>

<p>"I should say not," muttered Herc, squeezing
through. "It doesn't speak very much for navy
food," he added to himself, "if all the sailors can
squeeze through such a place as this."</p>

<p>At the bottom of the ladder they found themselves
in a small chamber, looking not unlike the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
central office of a telephone exchange. It was
quite hot, owing to its proximity to the boiler
room.</p>

<p>Everywhere wires ran, with head-pieces, like
those worn by operators, dangling from them.
Small bells were affixed to the steel bulkhead,
and a system of tiny signal lights was arranged
above them.</p>

<p>"This is the place from which the fire is directed
after the commands have been sent from the
fire-control well," explained their guide. "As
you see, it works like a telephone exchange. In
action, an officer and four men are stationed here
to attend to the signals."</p>

<p>"Are we under the water-line now?" asked
Ned breathlessly.</p>

<p>"We are now twenty feet below the surface of
the river," replied the boatswain's mate.</p>

<p>"Then, if the ship was sunk in action, the men
down here would not stand a chance to escape?"
queried Ned.</p>

<p>"No; they probably would not know that the
ship had been struck till they saw the water come
pouring in on them."</p>

<p>"Say, Ned," whispered Herc.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's one job in the navy that I don't
want."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"To be stationed down here."</p>

<p>"No danger of that," laughed Ned. "Only the
most expert of the crew&mdash;men to whom gunnery
is a science, are assigned to these posts."</p>

<p>A visit to the wireless room, which was set
snugly in the superstructure between the two forward
and the two after funnels, completed the
lads' tour of their new home.</p>

<p>"Now, I have done all I can for you," remarked
the boatswain's mate, as he parted from
the boys on the forward deck, "the rest lies in
your own hands. The only part of the ship you
have not seen is the magazines. As there are
two and one-half million dollars' worth of explosives
stored there, we naturally keep them private."</p>

<p>Lounging about with the other tars on the forward
deck the boys found their friend, Tom Marlin.
He had already heard about the accident
which had resulted in Herc's involuntary immersion
and Ned's voluntary ducking.</p>

<p>"I'm glad that you boys kept your heads," he
said, after the boys had recounted their experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
and suspicions to him; "the 'old man' is
very much averse to fighting; although on some
of the ships of the fleet they allow the men to
meet under proper conditions and fight out their
grievances with boxing gloves."</p>

<p>"We have no intention of letting Kennell go
unpunished, though," promised Ned indignantly.
"Why, for all he knew, he might have drowned
Herc here."</p>

<p>"You'd better steer clear of Kennell," warned
another sailor, who had come up with three companions
at this moment; "he's a dangerous man,
and could eat both you kids for breakfast, without
sauce or salt."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," breathed Ned truculently,
smarting under the sense of the mean trick
that had been played on his friend; "and, perhaps,
before this cruise is over, he may have a
chance to try."</p>

<p>This conversation took place on the forward
deck, in the short lounging interval allowed the
sailors between afternoon "setting-up" drill, and
the supper bugle, which is sounded at 5:30.</p>

<p>As Ned voiced his intention of squaring things
up at some future time, the brisk notes of the
summons to the evening meal cut short further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
talk, and as the chiming of "three bells" mingled
with the bugle's notes, the jackies descended on
the mess-tables like a flight of locusts on a wheatfield.
They were served with cold roast ham,
potato salad, boiled potatoes, canned peaches,
bread and butter, and steaming tea.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Herc, as his nostrils dilated under
the odors of appetizing food, and his eye fell
on the long rows of tables, spread with plates,
knives and forks, with a cup at each man's elbow,
"this is a lot more interesting to me right now
than all the underground subways in the navy."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BREAKING TWO ROOKIES.</p>


<p>A fresh breeze, tossing up the foamy white
caps; fleecy clouds, scurrying by overhead; and,
on the sparkling sea, spread in a long formidable
line, the North Atlantic squadron, steaming "in
column," bound for the battle practice at Guantanamo.
Between each of the huge battle bulldogs,
glistening wetly with the tossed-up spray,
a perfect distance was maintained&mdash;as accurately
as if the space between each ship in the long line
were fixed permanently; yet the squadron was
reeling off twenty knots an hour on its way to
tropic waters.</p>

<p>On the fore-deck of the <i>Manhattan</i>, which,
leviathan as she was, pitched heavily in the huge
Atlantic swells, stood the two Dreadnought Boys;
but a big change was manifest in the ruddy-headed
Herc's smiling features, since he sat down
to supper the night before the squadron sailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned regarded his chum with a smile at the
other's woe-begone look.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Herc," he said. "It will soon be
over, you know. Sea-sickness does not last long."</p>

<p>"A good thing it doesn't," groaned the unfortunate
Herc, "or I'd be finished with earthly
woes by this time. O-oh-oh-oh!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was forced from Ned's
cousin as the <i>Manhattan</i> gave an extra heavy
pitch which sent the salt foam flying in a wet
cloud over the port-bow.</p>

<p>It was the second morning following the fleet's
departure from New York. The night before,
after a day of agony, poor Herc had been hoisted
into his hammock by three sailors, and now, in
the early dawn, he was undergoing once more all
the torments of the day previous. Ned, on the
contrary, seemed unaffected by the motion of the
ship in the heavy sea-way, and had escaped
the toll old Neptune demands from most neophytes.</p>

<p>"Here, you boys," bluffly snapped a boatswain's
mate, approaching the boys; "what are you doing
here?" It was not the same petty officer who
had shown them about the ship.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," said Ned, respectfully saluting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
"but we haven't received any assignments
yet."</p>

<p>"Well, lay hold of a swab and get to work."</p>

<p>"A swab, sir?"</p>

<p>"It sounds what I feel like," groaned Herc.</p>

<p>"Yes, a deck-mop, if you like that term better.
No idlers allowed here."</p>

<p>"My friend here, is pretty sea-sick, sir," ventured
Ned respectfully.</p>

<p>"Never mind; a little work will do him good&mdash;work
and a good breakfast&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Breakfast oh-o-o-oh!" from the luckless Herc.</p>

<p>"Come, hammocks have been piped down for
five minutes. Have you stowed yours?" demanded
the boatswain's mate sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Ned, who had performed
this office both for himself and for his friend.</p>

<p>"Well, you will turn to with the first deck division
and scrub decks."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," said Ned, starting forward
to where he saw a number of jackies, armed with
swabs, preparing to begin the first daily task on
a man-o'-war. Scrubbing and painting and
cleaning brasswork are a Jackie's chief tasks at
sea.</p>

<p>"But hold on a minute&mdash;your boots."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The boatswain's mate glared downward disapprovingly.</p>

<p>"Have I lost those, too?" moaned Herc.</p>

<p>"Take off your boots, at once. Footgear is not
allowed while scrubbing decks."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. Come, Herc, we must go forward."</p>

<p>Followed by Herc, Ned made his way to the
fore superstructure, where swabs were being
served out. After a little inquiry, he found his
"station," and guided the half-dazed Herc into
his place in the scrubbing line. Soon they were
at work on one of those tasks which may
seem menial, but which every boy who enters
Uncle Sam's navy must learn to do without complaint.</p>

<p>"I didn't leave home to scrub floors," muttered
Herc indignantly, his disgust getting even the
better of his sea-sickness; "is this a sailor's
chore?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Herc; look at it from this angle&mdash;in
scrubbing decks you are helping to keep
your five-million-dollar home clean."</p>

<p>"I'd give five million dollars to be ashore,"
groaned Herc, a fresh paroxysm sweeping over
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the sharp cry of "Attention!" rang
along the decks.</p>

<p>The scrubbing squads straightened up stiffly,
and came to the position of salute.</p>

<p>It was the captain, making an early tour of
inspection with the executive officer of the ship,
Lieutenant-Commander Scott. Behind him came
his orderly and a messenger. Altogether, it was
quite an impressive little parade.</p>

<p>Ned thought that the captain, whom he had
last seen quelling the onrush of the crazed stokers,
glanced at him with a flash of recognition.
He knew enough, however, not to betray by the
flicker of an eyelash that he had ever seen his
commander before.</p>

<p>As for Herc, he was fortunately, perhaps, past
paying attention to anything.</p>

<p>"Tell the men to carry on," Ned heard the captain
say to the boatswain's mate in charge of his
scrubbing squad, as the officers passed by.</p>

<p>"Carry on," thought Ned; "what on earth is
that?"</p>

<p>"Come; carry on!" said boatswain's mate
sharply to Ned as the boy still stood at attention,
having received no order to resume work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned looked at him inquiringly, and the man
saw the lad was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Carry on. Go on with your work," he said,
and Ned at once understood the hitherto mysterious
order.</p>

<p>Breakfast followed the swabbing-down work,
and Herc, who felt somewhat revived, managed
to swallow a few mouthfuls. Not enough, however,
to completely restore him, and a shipmate,
seeing his despondent condition, advised him to
visit Pills.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the astonished boy.</p>

<p>"It isn't a 'what,' it's a 'he'," explained the
man; "Pills is the doctor."</p>

<p>"Well, if there's a doctor on board, I certainly
want to see him," agreed Herc; and, at seven-thirty,
together with several other men, suffering
from real or imaginary ills, he sought out
the ship's doctor, who gave him some remedies,
which soon made the boy feel all right. In fact,
an hour later Herc and Ned found themselves
consigned to a painting squad, working, side by
side, on the big forward turret which housed the
twelve-inch guns.</p>

<p>Beside them was another blue-jacket and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Tom, their acquaintance of their first day of
naval life.</p>

<p>Ned felt a thrill, as, in his bosn's chair, he dangled
on the side of the turret close to the glistening
barrels of the huge guns, which could hurl
a ponderous weight of metal, an 870-pound projectile,
almost ten miles. He wondered if he
would ever attain his present ambition, which
was to serve on the crew in the big forward turret,
the one he was then engaged in painting a
dull-slate color.</p>

<p>Conversation is allowed among blue-jackets at
work if they are discreet enough not to make
their tones too loud, and relapse into silence when
a petty or a commissioned officer happens along.
Thus Ned and the convalescent Herc found time
to ask many questions concerning the ship. Naturally,
the talk drifted, as they worked, to the
turret on which they were toiling.</p>

<p>"If I tell you boys a secret can you keep it&mdash;teetotal
abstinence?" asked old Tom suddenly.</p>

<p>"You had better not confide in us, if you don't
think so," rejoined Ned somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, no harm meant," hastily put in Tom;
"and at that, it isn't so much of a secret. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
been hinted at in the papers, and maybe you may
have heard of it. Have you?"</p>

<p>"Why, how can we tell unless we know what
it is?" questioned Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," confided old Tom seriously, and lowering
his voice&mdash;though by this time the third
man on their side of the turret was painting at
some distance from them&mdash;"well, inside this here
turret is one of the new Varian guns. They are
the invention of Henry Varian, of Boston&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The inventor of that new explosive?"
breathed Ned.</p>

<p>"Exactly; Chaosite, they call it. Well, this here
gun is specially built to handle this explosive, but
it's never been tried yet; and&mdash;here's the secret&mdash;Varian
himself is to join us in Cuba and direct
the firing tests of it. While the papers have got
hold of the fact that we have the gun on board,
none of them know that it is to be tested on this
battle practice, or that Varian himself is to meet
us at Guantanamo."</p>

<p>"How do you come to know all this?" asked
Ned.</p>

<p>"Why, I'm the stroke-oar of the captain's boat&mdash;when
he uses it&mdash;which isn't often, nowadays,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
lamented old Tom, who hadn't much use for
"steamers" and gasoline launches. "Well, when
we was at Key West, I rowed him ashore&mdash;helped
to, that is&mdash;and I overheard him talking to this
fellow Varian himself about the gun. I wasn't
eavesdropping, you understand; just overheard."</p>

<p>"That's mighty interesting," mused Ned; "of
course, I have read of the government's experiments
with Chaosite. It is supposed to be, I believe,
the most powerful of all explosives yet discovered.
It's great to think that we are on board
the first ship to try it under actual battle conditions."</p>

<p>"I wish we could get on the crew of that gun,"
put in Herc. "I'd like mighty well to see just how
that Chewusite acts when it's touched off. Regular
Fourth of July, I guess. Pop-boom-fizz! Up
in the air!&mdash;stars!&mdash;bang&mdash;down comes the
stick!"</p>

<p>As Herc spoke, in his newly recovered vitality,
he swung his pot of slate-colored paint about, to
illustrate his meaning. As ill-luck would have it,
the wire handle was not oversecurely fastened,
and off flew the receptacle of the pigment with
which the turret was being covered.</p>

<p>"Oh, crickey! Now I've done it!" groaned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Herc, as he felt the bucket slip from the handle
and go hurtling down.</p>

<p>The next moment Ned echoed his chum's exclamation
of dismay, as he saw what had occurred.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, at that very moment
the redoubtable Kennell was passing beneath the
turret, on his way aft to clean some brasswork,
and had turned his face upward, preparatory to
flinging some jeering remark at the two Dreadnought
Boys.</p>

<p>The contents of the unlucky pot of paint fell
full on his sneering features, blotting them out
in a sticky cloud of gray pigment!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BULLY GETS A LESSON.</p>


<p>For a moment the big form of the paint-covered
bully swayed about blindly and helplessly.
Then, dashing the paint from his eyes, he emitted
a roar like that of a stricken bull.</p>

<p>Jackies at work near at hand, who had seen
the accident, gazed at Herc, who had by this time
slid to the deck&mdash;in a sort of pitying way. They
knew Kennell too well to suppose that he would
let such an occurrence&mdash;even if it were an accident&mdash;pass
by unrevenged.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Kennell; it was an accident," exclaimed
Herc, one hand extended, and the other
gathering up the loose end of his work-blouse;
"here, let me wipe some of it off with this."</p>

<p>He stepped forward, with the intention of doing
all he could to repair the damage he had unwittingly
caused, but Kennell, with an angry
sweep of his arm, waved him furiously back. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
increase the bully's rage, some of the men near
at hand began to laugh.</p>

<p>"My! what a lovely complexion the kid has
when he's all rouged up!" laughed one.</p>

<p>"Kennell's got his battle-paint on," jeered another.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that none of the men particularly
regretted the accident to the bully, whom
none of them had any particular reason to love.</p>

<p>From their suspended bosn's chairs, Ned and
old Tom watched the scene with some apprehensions.
Ned was a shrewd enough reader of character
to know that the affair could hardly end by
Kennell's peaceably accepting Herc's apology;
while old Tom knew Kennell's nature too well to
entertain any doubt that the young seaman was
in for a terrible trouncing.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;red-headed clod-hopper!" grated
Kennell savagely through his mask of "war-paint,"
when he found his voice. Somehow, he
looked so ludicrous, showing his teeth, like a
snarling dog, through his panoply of pigment,
that Herc, to save his life, could not have restrained
himself from bursting into a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;pardon me, Kennell; oh, ha! ha! ha! ha!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
I&mdash;I'm awfully sorry. Please accept my apologies.
It was, ha, ha, ha, ha! an accident&mdash;really it
was. Won't you forgive me?"</p>

<p>Herc held out his hand once more. As he did
so, Ned shouted a sharp warning from above.</p>

<p>It came too late.</p>

<p>Kennell's mighty arm shot out with the speed
of a piston-rod, and its impact, full on Herc's
laughing face, carried the boy crashing against
the side rails.</p>

<p>"Take that, you pup, as a starter!" hissed Kennell
"and I'm not through with you yet, either.
I'll keep after you two whelps till you slink out
of the service."</p>

<p>Herc, half-stunned, clambered to his feet, and
stood swaying for a moment, as if he were about
to keel over altogether. He rapidly pulled himself
together, however, and fixed a furious gaze
on Kennell, who stood glaring at him with an
upcurled lip and narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>Echoing the bellow that Kennell had let forth
when the paint obscured his vision temporarily,
Herc threw himself into a boxing attitude, and
sprang straight for his opponent. It was the onslaught
of a wild-cat on a bull.</p>

<p>"Take that, for tripping me overboard, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
big coward," he snapped, as he aimed a terrific
uppercut at the ship's bully.</p>

<p>The unexpected blow caught Kennell with the
force of a young battering-ram. Full on the
point of his blunt jaw it landed, and raised him
a good foot off the deck. He came crashing down
like a felled tree, in a heap at the foot of the turret's
barbette.</p>

<p>He lay there, seemingly senseless, while the
ship plunged onward, and a thin stream of red
began to trickle from his head and spread over
the newly whitened deck.</p>

<p>Herc gazed down at his handiwork in consternation.</p>

<p>What if he had killed the man? Kennell lay
there so still that it seemed reasonable to suppose
that his life might be extinct. The stream of
blood, too, alarmed Herc, who had struck out
more on impulse than with any well-defined idea
of knocking out the ponderous "Kid Kennell."</p>

<p>"Kennell, Kennell!" he breathed, bending over
the prostrate man. "Speak! Are you badly
hurt?"</p>

<p>"Leave him alone, matey," counseled old Tom,
who, with Ned, had slid down from the turret-side.
"He's a long way from dead. He's just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
asleep for a few minutes, and only got what was
coming to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, is he all right?" questioned Herc, much
relieved.</p>

<p>"Sure; it would take a harder punch than
you've got to hurt 'Kid' Kennell seriously," put
in a sailor at Herc's elbow; "but Heaven help
you when the kid gets about again."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Herc simply.</p>

<p>"Why? Oh, Lord!" groaned the sailors mirthfully,
"why, red-head, he'll pound that ruby-colored
head of yours into the middle of next Fourth
of July or pink calves'-foot jelly."</p>

<p>"Carry on, men! Carry on!" exclaimed a
boatswain's mate, coming round the barbette at
this moment.</p>

<p>"Why, what's all this?" he exclaimed the next
minute, as his eyes lighted on the recumbent and
paint-smeared figure of Kennell, and the flushed
faces and anxious eyes of Ned and Herc.</p>

<p>"It's Kennell, sir; he's knocked out," volunteered
one of the jackies.</p>

<p>"So I see. Who has so grossly violated the
rules of the service as to have been guilty of
fighting?"</p>

<p>All eyes rested on poor Herc, who, coloring up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to the roots of his colorful thatch, said, in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"I have, sir."</p>

<p>Though the lad's tone was low, his voice never
quavered.</p>

<p>"What you&mdash;Recruit Taylor&mdash;fighting?" queried
the amazed boatswain's mate, who was no
stranger to the record of the redoubtable
Kennell, and inwardly marveled at what sort of
fighting machine Herc must be to have laid him
low.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm sorry to say that I have," replied
Herc, looking his superior straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>At this juncture the officer of the deck hastened
up. From his station amidships he had
noted the sudden cessation of all activity forward.
He had at once hastened to see what had
occurred to stop the monotonous clock-work of
the routine duties aboard.</p>

<p>"What's all this, Stowe?" he shot out sharply
at the boatswain's mate, as his eyes took in the
scene.</p>

<p>All the jackies had come to attention as the
officer hurried up, but at his sharp command
of:</p>

<p>"Carry on, men!" the work had gone forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
apparently as before, although, as my readers
will judge, the men had one eye on
their work and another on the scene that
now transpired.</p>

<p>"Why, as well as I can make out, sir, this
young recruit here, sir&mdash;Taylor, sir&mdash;has been
fighting with Kennell, here, sir, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Seemingly knocked him out," snapped the officer,
as Kennell began to stir. He sat up, blinking
his eyes like a man who has been summoned
back from another world.</p>

<p>As the bully rose, the officer&mdash;a young man
with a good-natured face&mdash;suddenly coughed violently
and turned to the rail. His shoulders
heaved and his handkerchief was stuffed up to
his face.</p>

<p>The boatswain's mate gazed at him apprehensively.
He thought his superior had become suddenly
ill. As a matter of fact the sight of Kennell's
puzzled countenance, blinking through the
paint and vital fluid, with which his features were
bedaubed, had been too much for the officer's
gravity, and he had been compelled to turn away
or suffer a severe loss of his dignity by bursting
into a roar of laughter.</p>

<p>Finally he recovered himself, and turned, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
a still quivering lip, which he bit incessantly,
toward the battered Kennell and the others.</p>

<p>"What explanation have you to make of this?"
he demanded of Herc, in as unshaken and stern
a voice as if he had never suffered the loss of an
ounce of his gravity.</p>

<p>Poor Herc saluted and shuffled uneasily from
one foot to another.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know he'll make a mess of it," thought
Ned to himself. "I wish the regulations would
allow me to speak up for him."</p>

<p>"Come, sir; what have you to say?" reiterated
the officer, as the sorry-looking Kennell got slowly
to his feet. He glowered menacingly at Herc, as
recollection of what had occurred began to come
back to him.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, that young cur&mdash;&mdash;" Kennell began.</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!" roared the officer; "I'll attend
to you when your turn comes."</p>

<p>"I was painting the side of the turret," began
Herc; "and, quite by accident, the handle of my
painting pail came off. Unfortunately, this man
happened to be passing below and the stuff doused
him, just like a sheep at dipping time, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Attention, sir! Never mind your comparisons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Proceed. You have not yet accounted for
the extraordinary condition of this man's countenance."</p>

<p>"Why, sir, <i>that's</i> the paint," sputtered Herc, as
if astonished at the officer's simplicity.</p>

<p>"Exactly. I understand. You say that such
a thing was an accident. Possibly, it was. But
how do you account for the fact that the man
Kennell was lying insensible at the foot of the
turret, with that cut over his eye?"</p>

<p>"I did that, too, sir," admitted Herc ruefully.</p>

<p>"What, you cut his eye like that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I guess that he must have done that
when he fell. I just gave him a sleep wallop&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Attention, sir! Use more respectful intelligible
language," said the lieutenant, suddenly
becoming much more interested in some object
on the far horizon; so much so that he had once
more to turn his back on the Dreadnought Boys,
the boatswain's mate and the open-mouthed jackies.
In a minute he faced round again, as grave
as before.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not sea-sick, sir?" began Herc
solicitously, for he had observed the officer's
handkerchief at his mouth. The lad could not
imagine that a scene so serious to him could appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
ludicrous to any one else. "If you are, Pills,
the doctor, I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir! You need disciplining. You admit,
then, that you hit this man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence! Answer 'yes' or 'no,' please."</p>

<p>"Well, 'yes'," admitted Herc.</p>

<p>"Why in the great horn-spoon doesn't he ask
him if Kennell hit him first?" groaned Ned, regarding
the examination from a prudent distance.</p>

<p>"This case calls for a full investigation,"
snapped the officer; "fighting aboard a man-o'-war
is one of the most serious offenses an enlisted
man can commit. Messenger!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Get the master-at-arms, and request him to
come forward and report to me at once."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>The messenger sped aft on his errand, while
a dreadful silence ensued, which even the irrepressible
Herc had not the courage to break.</p>

<p>Evidently something dire was about to happen
to him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC LEARNS WHAT "THE BRIG" IS.</p>


<p>In a few minutes the messenger returned with
the master-at-arms, who saluted the officer of the
deck, who in turn gravely saluted him. Herc,
feeling that he should do something, saluted each
of them in turn, concluding his respectful motions
with a deep bow.</p>

<p>Neither officer, however, paid any more attention
to the lad than if he had been carved out of
wood.</p>

<p>"Master-at-arms!" began the officer.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded the master-at-arms,
bringing his heels together with a sharp click.</p>

<p>"There has been a flagrant breach of discipline
here, which it is my duty to report to the captain
at once. You will place this man, Ordinary Seaman
Taylor, under restraint, and arraign him at
the mast at one o'clock with the other prisoners."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," nodded the master-at-arms, edging
up to the dismayed Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kennell, if you wish to prefer a complaint
against this man Taylor, you may," went on the
officer.</p>

<p>"I do, sir, certainly," said Kennell earnestly,
through the paint that smothered his face; "but
first, sir, I should like to clean this mess off, sir."</p>

<p>"You will be relieved from duty while you do.
Carry on, men."</p>

<p>The officer of the deck faced about and walked
aft; no doubt to acquaint the captain with the
details of the occurrences on the forward deck.</p>

<p>"Come, wake up," said the master-at-arms to
Herc, who was in a semi-stupor at the horrifying
idea that he was under arrest. "Come with me."</p>

<p>"What! I'm to be locked up?" gasped Herc.</p>

<p>"Yes, in the brig."</p>

<p>In an instant the recollection of the boys' conversation
with old Tom on the day they joined
the ship flashed into Herc's mind. So then "the
brig" that the old tar had been so reluctant to
talk about, was the place in which they locked
up malefactors and disgracers of the service, of
whom it seemed he was one. Poor Herc felt ready
to drop with shame and humiliation as&mdash;under
the eyes of the hundreds of jackies going about
their various tasks&mdash;he was marched aft by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
master-at-arms. There was only one drop of relief
in his bitter cup. It came when Ned pressed
forward, at the risk of being severely reproved.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Herc, old fellow," he breathed.
"I know you were in the right, and I'll see that
Kennell gets what's coming to him, if it's the last
thing I do."</p>

<p>"Come, sir! carry on," snapped the master-at-arms,
who had pretended not to notice the first
part of this conversation, being a really kind-hearted
man, although bound by discipline, just
as is every one else in the navy; "you must know
it is a breach of discipline to talk to prisoners."</p>

<p>Prisoners!</p>

<p>Poor Herc groaned aloud.</p>

<p>"Come, come," comforted the master-at-arms,
"it isn't as bad as all that. I am confident that
you can clear yourself. Besides, it is your first
offense, and you are a recruit, so perhaps the
old man will be easy on you."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, so much as it's the disgrace of
being arrested like this," burst out Herc.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you shouldn't go to fighting, then,"
remarked the master-at-arms, pulling open a
steel-studded door and thrusting Herc before him
into a narrow passage, lighted by electric bulbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
down one side of which was fitted a row of steel-barred
cells.</p>

<p>"We're a bit crowded," he remarked, "so I
can't give you a cell to yourself. When a ship
puts to sea out of a port there are generally a
lot of men to be disciplined. Those who have
overstayed their leave, and so forth. Therefore,
I'll have to put you in here."</p>

<p>He opened a door as he spoke, and pushed Herc
into a cell in which two other men were already
seated on a narrow bench which ran along one
side.</p>

<p>"You'll get a full ration at eight bells, for
which you are lucky," remarked the master-at-arms;
"the others get only bread and water."</p>

<p>Clang!</p>

<p>The steel door swung to, and Herc, for the first
time in his life, was a prisoner.</p>

<p>It did not make the experience any the less bitter
to know that he was a captive and disgraced
through no fault of his own, unless it had been
from his exuberant swinging of the paint-pot in
the enthusiasm of his newly-acquired "sea-legs."</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy, despite his unpleasant
situation, was naturally inquisitive enough to
gaze about him on his surroundings. The cell itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was a steel-walled apartment about twelve
feet square with no other furnishings than the
narrow bench, which also was of steel. It was
lighted by an electric bulb, set deep in the ceiling
and barred off, so that it could not be tampered
with by a meddlesome prisoner. The walls of
this place were painted white. The floors red.
It was insufferably hot and stuffy, and the songs
of a group of roisterers confined in another cell,
which broke forth as soon as the master-at-arms
departed, did not tend to make the environment
any pleasanter.</p>

<p>"So this is the brig," mused Herc, "well, they
can have it for all I want with it. It's not much
better than the hog-pen at home."</p>

<p>One of Herc's fellow prisoners, who had been
sitting sullenly on the bench, now arose and began
to pace back and forth. His companion did
likewise. They had not paid the slightest attention
to Herc hitherto, but now one of them spoke.</p>

<p>"What you in for, kid?"</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have to ask the master-at-arms,"
rejoined Herc, who was not prepossessed
by his questioner's appearance. He was a heavy-set,
low-browed man, with a pair of black eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that almost met in the center of his forehead,
giving him a sinister aspect. His companion
was slight, and long-legged, with a delicate&mdash;almost
an effeminate&mdash;cast of features.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you don't want to talk you don't
have to," growled the heavy-browed man. "Say,
Carl," he went on, turning to his companion,
"this is a nice, sociable cellmate they've given us,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You attend to your own affairs, Silas,"
snarled the other, who did not seem to be any
more amiable than his heavy-browed friend;
"leave the kid alone. We've got trouble enough
of our own, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Hum, yes; but overstaying leave isn't such a
very serious matter, and think of the reward
that's ahead in store for us. Only this cruise,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" broke in the one addressed as Carl,
with an angry intonation; "you must be a fool
to talk like that in front of the kid," he went on
in a low undertone.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" snarled the other in the same low
voice, however. "He's just a country Reuben,
with the hayseed still in his hair and the smell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the hog-pen on him&mdash;like that one we gambled
with in New York&mdash;Hank Harkins&mdash;wasn't that
his name?&mdash;on the old 'Idy'."</p>

<p>"Just the same, it's well to be prudent," counseled
the other, and fell once more to his pacing
of the cell.</p>

<p>As for Herc, to whom all this, including the
reference to Hank, had been, as Carl had guessed,
so much Greek, he laid down at full length on the
bench. As he had not had more than a few
winks of sleep during his seasick night, he soon
dropped off into peaceful slumber, despite his uncomfortable
couch and serious position.</p>

<p>How long he slept, he did not know, but he
woke with a start, and was about to open his
eyes, when he suddenly closed them again and
feigned deep slumber.</p>

<p>He had heard something being discussed by
the two men with whom he shared the cell that
set his pulse to stirring and his heart to beating
a wild tattoo.</p>

<p>The boy realized that the safety of one of the
United States' greatest naval secrets lay, for the
time being, in his hands.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A PLOT OVERHEARD.</p>


<p>"Say, didn't that boy move?"&mdash;the prisoner
that Herc knew as Carl put the question.</p>

<p>The lad heard rapid footsteps pace across the
narrow cell, and felt the hot breath of one of
the men in his ear as he lay still and feigned
slumber as best he could, although his heart beat
so wildly he was sure its agitation must have
been audible to the two men.</p>

<p>Apparently, however, his ruse succeeded. The
men were satisfied that he was wrapped in slumber,
for, with a growl, the one that had bent over
him said:</p>

<p>"He's off; sound as a top."</p>

<p>"A good thing," rejoined the other, "both for
us and for him."</p>

<p>It was Carl who spoke, and the tone in which
his soft, refined voice uttered the words left the
Dreadnought Boy no room to doubt that if the
two plotters had imagined he had overheard them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
they would have done something exceedingly
unpleasant to prevent their secret being betrayed.
As it was, however, they seemed to feel no uneasiness
and resumed their conversation.</p>

<p>"The yacht will be waiting at Boco del Toros,
about ten miles above Guantanamo Bay," continued
the black-browed man. Herc recognized his
bearlike growl. "All we have to do when we get
the plans is to steal aboard and sail. Her captain
will be prepared for us, and will take us on board
when we give the signal."</p>

<p>"Then all that we will have to do will be to
waylay Varian," said Carl in his soft way, which,
mild as it seemed, yet impressed Herc with the
same sense of chill as if the cold muzzle of a
revolver had been pressed to the nape of his
neck.</p>

<p>"That's it. An easy way of earning ten thousand
dollars, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if&mdash;if we don't get caught."</p>

<p>"No fear of that," laughed the black-browed
man; "at any rate, if we are it will be our own
fault. But I see no chance of a slip-up. Varian
sails from New York to Havana on a vessel of
the Ward line. He will put up at a hotel at
Guantanamo. We are to meet the others ashore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and if all goes well we'll finish our business in a
few hours. If not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if not, we'll have to get what we're
after from the captain himself, and that's going
to be difficult and perhaps fatal for him."</p>

<p>"Well, I've taken longer chances than that for
less money," laughed Carl's companion. "Lucky
thing they didn't look back into our records, or
they'd have found out a thing or two which would
have made us very undesirable subjects for Uncle
Sam's navy. Likewise Kennell, I guess. I'd 'a'
hard time to get him to join, but a golden bait
will catch the shyest fish."</p>

<p>Carl gave a high-pitched chuckle, almost a
giggle, but the two worthies instantly lapsed into
what seemed sullen silence as the key of their
jailer grated in the lock of the bulkhead door.</p>

<p>As for Herc, he judged that his best and safest
course was to emit a loud snore, which he did.
So well was his slumber simulated that the master-at-arms
who had entered, accompanied by two
orderlies carrying the prisoners' food, exclaimed
in an astonished tone:</p>

<p>"That youngster must be an older hand than
I thought him. He's actually sleeping like a
baby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Herc pretended to feel very sleepy when the
master-at-arms shook his shoulder and indicated
a smoking dinner of cornbeef and cabbage,
flanked by bread and butter and a big mug of
coffee.</p>

<p>"Here, wake up and eat this," commanded the
officer; "you ought to be alive to your luck. The
other prisoners only get full rations once a day.
They have to dine on bread and water."</p>

<p>The boy stretched his arms as if he was only
partially awake, and, after what he judged to be
a proper interval of feigning sleepiness, fell to
on his hot dinner. Empty as he was, the food
heartened him up wonderfully, despite the scowls
that his two companions leveled at him as he ate.
When the master-at-arms arrived, just before
two bells&mdash;one o'clock&mdash;to take his prisoners to
the tribunal at the mast, Sam felt better prepared
to face his ordeal than he had a few hours previously.</p>

<p>The captain's "court" convened just forward
of the stern awnings, and a little abaft the towering
"cage" aftermast.</p>

<p>The "old man," in full uniform, with a sword
at his side, Lieutenant-Commander Scott, and
several of the officers stood in a little group chatting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
as the prisoners were brought aft. All
wore side arms and what the Jackie calls "quarter-deck
faces"&mdash;meaning that they looked as
stern and uncompromising as flint.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll get life," muttered Herc to himself,
as he heard the stern doom, of stoppage of
five days' pay and ten days in the brig, without
future shore leave, pronounced on three
sailors who had been found guilty of coming
on duty in an intoxicated condition, at New
York.</p>

<p>"You men are to understand that the United
States navy has no place for men who wilfully
indulge in such practices," the captain had said,
with blighting emphasis, as the men trembled before
him. "Clean men, clean-living men is the
material the government wants, and such as you
are better out of the service. The navy is better
off without you if you go on as you have been
doing."</p>

<p>Herc felt his cheeks blanch as pale as had the
countenances of the guilty ones as he heard this
stern speech.</p>

<p>Next came the turns of the two men who had
shared the same cell with him.</p>

<p>"Carl Schultz, ordinary seaman, and Silas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Wagg, ordinary seaman," read the captain's yeoman
who acted as a sort of "clerk of the court."</p>

<p>"What's the offense?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Overstaying their shore leave four hours,
sir," was the rejoinder.</p>

<p>"Any previous bad record?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I have found none," volunteered
the master-at-arms.</p>

<p>"Men," said the captain, in the same icy tones
as he had used toward the three intemperate prisoners,
"you are guilty of a serious offense. In
the navy regularity should be a watchword with
all of us. It may seem to you that to overstay
your leave by four hours was but a small matter,
and that you yourselves would not be missed
among eight hundred or more men. Yet every
one of the crew and each of your forty-two officers
has a niche of his own to fill. We are all
cogs in the same great machine, servants working
for the good of the same government.</p>

<p>"If any one of us is derelict in his duty, he is
not only derelict to himself and to his officers, but
to his country and his flag. Always bear that in
mind. As this is your first offense, and your officers
tell me you are hard-working men and good
seamen, I shall dismiss you with a reprimand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
But mind," he added sternly, "if either of you is
brought before me again I shall not prove so lenient.
Carry on."</p>

<p>With grateful faces, the two men hastened off
forward.</p>

<p>How Herc longed to tell of what he had heard
in the cell! But he dreaded to make himself appear
ridiculous by reciting what might seem an
improbable story, cooked up by one who already
rested under a cloud, so he said nothing.</p>

<p>In fact, he was not allowed long to entertain
these thoughts, for hardly had the two worthies
who had shared his cell made the best of their
way forward, before the yeoman, in a voice that
affected Herc much as a sudden plunge into ice
water would have done, shouted out:</p>

<p>"Ordinary Seaman Taylor!"</p>

<p>The story of Herc's knocking out the bully had
already spread through the ship&mdash;a place where
gossip travels as swiftly as through a small village&mdash;and
the officers and the few men whose
duties brought them near to the "court room"&mdash;eyed
Herc curiously as he stepped forward, with
head bared, holding himself as erect as possible.
He saluted as he clicked his heels together with
painstaking precision. His heart beat fast and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
thick, however, and there was an anxious look in
his eyes as he faced his inquisitors.</p>

<p>Herc was a brave boy, full of pluck and grit;
but the ordeal before him might have caused a
stouter heart than his to quail.</p>

<p>"Master-at-arms, what do you know about this
case?" asked the captain, as Herc stood rigid,
twisting his cap in his big hands.</p>

<p>The master-at-arms rapidly rehearsed what he
knew of the affair, and then the captain turned
to his executive officer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Scott, there is a complainant in this case,
is there not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," was the reply. "Mr. Andrews,
who had the deck this morning, so reported to
me."</p>

<p>"Able Seaman and Gunner Ralph Kennell is
the man, sir," said Lieutenant Andrews, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>"Very good. Where is this man Kennell?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said Kennell, stepping forward in
his turn.</p>

<p>His face shone with soap, which yet had not
been able wholly to eradicate the traces of slate-colored
paint with which he had been shower-bathed.
Over his left eye a big bit of plaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
showed where "Pills" had patched him up. Beneath
the same eye a dark bruise was beginning
to spread. His jaw was also woefully swollen
where Herc had landed his effective blow.</p>

<p>"Now, Kennell," began the captain, who was
perfectly aware of the bully's record, and marvelled
as much as his officers how such a slim lad
as Herc could have inflicted such injuries on him;
"now, Kennell, tell us in as few words as you
can what occurred this morning between you and
Ordinary Seaman Taylor."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," began Kennell sullenly, "I was
making my way aft to clean brasswork, sir, when
this man here, sir, drops a pot of paint on my
head, sir, out of pure malice, as I believe, sir."</p>

<p>"Never mind what you believe. What happened
then?"</p>

<p>"Then, when I protested, sir," went on Kennell,
"he climbs down from the turret he was
a-painting, sir, and strikes me."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Right by the forward twelve-inch turret, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean your eye, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, he struck me all over, sir," complained
Kennell.</p>

<p>"And you had done nothing to him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good. You may stand aside. Taylor,
what have you to say to this story?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir, except that it is a fabrication,"
said Herc indignantly, his fear at the officers
swallowed in his wrath at Kennell's lying tale.
"It is true I dropped the paint on his head. That
was accidental, however. So far as his injuries
go, I believe that he got the cut over his eye when
he fell against the turret. He hit it an awful
whack, sir." Herc grinned broadly at the recollection.</p>

<p>"No levity, please. You are to understand this
is a serious matter. Who struck the first blow?"</p>

<p>Herc hesitated. It was no part of his ideas of
what was right to tell tales on a fellow seaman,
and yet Kennell had lied cruelly about him. Suddenly
his mind was made up.</p>

<p>"I had rather not say, sir," he said at length in
a low tone.</p>

<p>"What! Are you aware that this is a confession
of guilt, or equivalent to it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, sir, but I cannot say," repeated
Herc stubbornly.</p>

<p>"Very well, then," said the captain in his most
dignified tones, "I shall have to inflict a heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
punishment on you than I would otherwise. You
are one of the two recruits whose gallant conduct
on the <i>Rhode Island</i> caught my favorable attention.
I am therefore doubly reluctant to punish
you. But the discipline of the service must be
upheld. Seemingly, you are screening some one.
You must learn that your officers are to be obeyed,
and also the regulations. No regulation is more
mandatory than that forbidding fighting and unseemly
conduct on the ships of the United States
Navy. I shall therefore sentence you to two days
in the brig with prison rations. Master-at-arms!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Carry on!"</p>

<p>The officer saluted, and a few minutes later
poor Herc was once more in his steel cell. This
time he occupied it alone, however.</p>

<p>"Well, two days is not such a very long time,"
mused Herc philosophically; "and I expected at
least two months, by the way that captain talked
to me. I'm in here now, but let that old 'dog
Kennel' look out for me when I'm foot loose
again!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Scott," said Captain Dunham, turning to
his lieutenant-commander, "ask Mr. Andrews to
step here a minute, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded Mr. Scott, and a minute
later Lieutenant Andrews respectfully saluted
Commander Dunham.</p>

<p>"Andrews, I'm not altogether comfortable
about giving that lad two days in the brig. The
fellow Kennell I have heard is a most unconscionable
bully, and, moreover, I am favorably inclined
to both those lads. I saw their mettle well
tested on the <i>Rhode Island</i>, as I told you gentlemen
the other day. Have you heard any details
of the matter which you could not relate officially
at the inquiry?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I have," said Mr. Andrews straightforwardly.
"I learned a short time ago, from a
boatswain's mate who arrived on the scene shortly
after Kennell had been knocked out, that young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Taylor, instead of being the aggressor, had, as a
matter of fact, been attacked by Kennell a few
minutes after he had extended his hand and offered
an apology for an unavoidable, if annoying,
accident."</p>

<p>"Hum, hum!" mused the captain; "then it
seems that there has been a miscarriage of justice
here. But why, in the name of the old
Harry, couldn't the young fellow have acquainted
me with the full details of the case."</p>

<p>"I suppose, sir, that he was unwilling to inform
on his shipmate. You know that 'snitchers,'
as they call them forward, are not encouraged
in the navy."</p>

<p>"No, Andrews, no. But I hate to think I have
done the lad an injustice&mdash;even if unwittingly."</p>

<p>"I should not worry about it, sir," put in Andrews.
"It will not hurt the youngster to get a
sharp lesson in naval discipline which he won't
forget in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," mused the captain;
"but I should be unwilling to spoil what I am
sure is a fine disposition by over-harshness. As
for that man Kennell, I have been his commander
on another ship of the fleet, the old <i>Massachusetts</i>.
I am sure he is a trouble maker, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
going to have a sharp eye kept on him. If I can
detect him attempting to stir up trouble among
the men, I shall visit my wrath on him pretty
sharply."</p>

<p>"And rightly, too, sir," agreed Andrews. "So
you have decided to let young Taylor serve out
his sentence?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes&mdash;for one day, anyway," rejoined
the commander. "As you say, it will be
a good lesson, though a sharp one. I intend,
however, to put both those lads on a good detail
as soon as Taylor is released. It will be by way
of compensation for what I feel is a partial injustice."</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that, while naval officers
outwardly have often to "ship a quarter-deck
face" and deal out what may seem harsh measures,
yet they are, with few exceptions, kindly,
humane men, with an adoration for their flag and
country that amounts to fanaticism, and, moreover,
a kindly feeling toward the men serving
under them. It is somewhat hard, though, to
administer the exact measure of justice among
eight or nine hundred high-spirited, healthy
young animals like the average American tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Well, lad, the smoke lamp is lighted. Light
up and forget your troubles."</p>

<p>Old Tom paused as he passed Ned during the
rest hour, after the jackies' noonday dinner.</p>

<p>"Thanks. I never smoke," responded the boy,
whose troubled face showed that he was still
worrying over Herc's disgrace. In fact, Ned
took his companion's position to heart much more
keenly than did Herc himself, who, knowing in
his own heart that he was not to blame, set to
work to make the best of it.</p>

<p>It was the day following Herc's imprisonment,
and already the squadron had passed into the
Gulf Stream, and the warm air of the tropics was
about the mighty fighting ships.</p>

<p>That morning the flagship had signalled to the
squadron that white uniforms were in order, and
very trim and neat the jackies looked in their
snowy garments, as they lounged about the decks.
Some were smoking and chatting, some writing
letters, and others playing checkers, chess or
cards, or absorbed in some book in a quiet nook.</p>

<p>As Ned, who was leaning over the rail, gazed
downward at the foam flying past the vessel's
side, he found never-failing amusement in watching
the great flocks of flying fish that fled shimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
from the yellow patches of "gulf weed"
as the <i>Manhattan's</i> mighty bow nosed into
them.</p>

<p>"For all the world like a covey of partridges
scared up in the woods at home," thought Ned
to himself.</p>

<p>"Ordinary Seaman Strong?" asked a sudden
voice behind him.</p>

<p>Ned turned swiftly, and saw the captain's orderly
facing him.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Strong," he said.</p>

<p>"Come with me," directed the orderly.</p>

<p>Ned had been long enough on a battleship now
to obey without hesitation or question when an
order was addressed to him.</p>

<p>The lounging jackies regarded him with some
interest as he passed among them.</p>

<p>"The pal of the red-headed lad is going to get
a wigging now."</p>

<p>"Two of them upon the carpet in two days.
They won't last long in the service."</p>

<p>These are samples of the comments that were
bandied about as the boy passed along behind the
orderly, somewhat troubled, in fact, in his own
mind as to what could be the reason of the sudden
summons to the captain's cabin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Old Tom spoke up indignantly as he heard the
remarks:</p>

<p>"A whole lot of you young varmints will still
be scrubbing decks, and cleaning brasswork, and
doing your regular trick in the brig after shore
leave, when them two young fellows is wearing
chevrons!" he snapped.</p>

<p>The old salt was a privileged character, and
did and said pretty much as he liked among the
men; but his remark aroused some resentment
among those about him.</p>

<p>"How about you, old Growler?" asked a gruff
voice. "How is it you never rose from the scrub
stations?"</p>

<p>"'Cos I was a fool like you when I was young,"
snarled old Tom, as the sailors exploded in a
shout of laughter at the discomfiture of the venturesome
spirit that had essayed to "bait" old
Tom.</p>

<p>"Better leave Tom alone, Ralph," shouted one
of the card players; "he's too sharp for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, he presumes on his gray hairs to do as
he likes," snarled the other, who was none other
than Kennell. "It's a good thing for him he's
got a bald head."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't need a pot of paint to cover it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
anyhow!" laughed old Tom, at which there was
another tornado of laughter; and Kennell, with
a black look on his face, rose to his feet and made
his way to another spot, one where he was less
likely to encounter such a sharp tongue as old
Tom's.</p>

<p>"Confounded old fool!" he muttered to himself
as he went, "I'd like to finish up him and those
two kids at one stroke! I'll do it, too, if I get a
chance."</p>

<p>In the meantime Ned, at the orderly's heels,
had traversed several of the memorable narrow,
steel-lined corridors, and at last found himself
in front of heavy green plush portieres, beyond
which lay, as he guessed, that hallowed spot, the
captain's cabin.</p>

<p>The orderly knocked softly at the polished mahogany
door frame.</p>

<p>"Ord'ly, sir," he announced.</p>

<p>And a minute later:</p>

<p>"Ordinary Seaman Strong, sir."</p>

<p>"Send him in," came the pleasant, mellow voice
of the captain.</p>

<p>Ned subdued an inclination to take to his heels,
and entered, looking as calm as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"A moment, Strong," said the captain in a
pleasant voice. "I'll be through here in a minute."</p>

<p>Ned stood stiffly at attention and gazed about
him out of the corners of his eyes while his commander
wrote busily, dipping his pen from time
to time in a massive silver ink-stand. The commander's
quarters, although on a fighting ship,
were as luxuriously appointed as the library in
any mansion ashore. The fittings were all dark
mahogany, relieved, here and there, with maple-wood,
on which the soft lights glowed and shone.
As in the officers' cabins, there was no porthole,
the armor at this part of the ship precluding any
such device. Thick glass, let into the quarter
deck above, however, admitted light.</p>

<p>"Ord'ly!"</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>The orderly sprang into view, like a familiar
spirit, from behind the curtain where he had been
standing at attention.</p>

<p>"Take these general orders to Mr. Scott!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>The galvanic orderly saluted and was off like
a shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder if that fellow is equipped with
springs?" mused Ned, "or if he is galvanized
daily, or merely wound up by clockwork?"</p>

<p>"Well, Strong."</p>

<p>The captain was gazing at the boy quizzically.</p>

<p>Ned saluted stiffly, and stood straighter than
ever at attention, waiting for what was to come.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BIT OF PROMOTION.</p>


<p>"Strong," began the captain, "I sent for you
to ask you a few questions. As you know, I
have taken some interest in you since I witnessed
your courageous behavior aboard the <i>Rhode
Island</i>."</p>

<p>Ned blushed hotly, but said nothing. The captain's
remark did not seem to call for a reply.</p>

<p>"You have ambitions, and your friend Taylor
has also, I presume."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Ned; "we wish to advance
ourselves in our chosen profession, sir."</p>

<p>"I am going to give you a chance," was the
rejoinder. "You are, of course, acquainted with
the rudiments of gunnery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We were schooled in the elements
of gun practice at Newport."</p>

<p>"So I perceived by a perusal of your papers."</p>

<p>This was news to Ned, who had not hitherto
dreamed that the commander of a vessel like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<i>Manhattan</i> would have time to pay any attention
to two mere ordinary seamen. In this, however,
he was mistaken. The officers of the United
States Navy are ever on the lookout for new
material, and watch any promising youngsters
with keen interest, giving them every opportunity
to show what they can do.</p>

<p>"I am going to put you and your friend Taylor
on a gun crew."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir!" burst out Ned, his eyes
almost popping out of his head, but preserving a
cool exterior, nevertheless.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. I have not finished yet,"
went on the captain, with a twinkle in his eye.
"Your friend Taylor is er-er somewhat impulsive,
I should imagine?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir; but he had plenty of provocation
for what he did the other day," spoke up
Ned boldly. He was delighted that a chance
had come to tell the facts in the case which
poor Herc, in his embarrassment, had neglected
doing.</p>

<p>"So I understood. The man Kennell, I understand,
attacked him. For this reason Taylor will
be released to-day. But even so, he had his recourse
in reporting the matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was not all, sir," broke out Ned.</p>

<p>"Not all? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That I saw the man Kennell deliberately trip
Herc&mdash;Seaman Taylor, I mean, sir&mdash;as he was
walking the boom the day he boarded the <i>Manhattan</i>."</p>

<p>"You mean the day you dived over after him?
It was pluckily done."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Kennell had been badgering him in
the boat, and then deliberately tripped him."</p>

<p>"That chimes in with the reports I have heard
about Kennell," remarked the captain. "However,
that matter is past, and official action cannot
now be taken. I have spoken to the gunnery
officer, Lieutenant Timmons, about you two
boys, and to-morrow you will be a part of the
crew of the fifteen-inch guns in the forward turret."</p>

<p>Ned's heart was too full for utterance. He
stammered his thanks, and obeying the captain's
curt nod of dismissal, hastened from the cabin,
his head fairly buzzing over the good luck that
had come to them.</p>

<p>"If I am not mistaken," thought the captain,
as Ned left the cabin, "I have selected two good
bits of material in those lads for Timmons. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the experiments with that Varian gun are going
to be dangerous, and perhaps I was wrong to
place those two boys in peril. However, the life
of a sailor is made up of risk and danger, and
there is no more danger with that gun than with
any other piece of modern ordnance. It is only
because it is untried that it seems more fraught
with possible mishap."</p>

<p>Had the captain possessed the gift of prophecy&mdash;&mdash; But
what man or woman does? If they
did, perhaps many of the experiments which have
proved of the biggest ultimate benefit to the world
would never have been tried.</p>

<p>Ned, his head fairly buzzing with his good
fortune, hastened forward. He wished he could
communicate with Herc and cheer up that captive
by news of their good fortune. Musing thus,
he had the misfortune, as he reached the fore
deck, to collide with a man hastening in an opposite
direction.</p>

<p>He looked up with a quick word of apology,
and found himself gazing full into the scowling
features of the Dreadnought Boys' arch enemy&mdash;Kennell!</p>

<p>"Out of my way, you young mucker!" glowered
the man, with a look of hatred, "or I'll maul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
you up as badly as I did that red-headed young
cub."</p>

<p>"You mean my friend, Herc Taylor."</p>

<p>"I said 'cub!'"</p>

<p>"And I said friend!"</p>

<p>Ned returned the man's glare firmly.</p>

<p>"I see I shall have to give you a good
lesson, too, one of these days!" hissed Kennell
evilly.</p>

<p>Ned, fresh from the presence of the captain,
proud of his promotion&mdash;for so he considered it,
the twelve-inch turret being the "prize detail" of
the ship&mdash;had no desire to get into a fistic argument.
He knew the captain was a stickler for
discipline, for all his kind heart, and that with
one of the Dreadnought Boys already undergoing
punishment, although unjustly, it would be the
worst thing that could happen for him to become
embroiled with Kennell.</p>

<p>He therefore regarded Kennell with a cold
stare and said sharply:</p>

<p>"Let me pass, please. I am in a hurry and
have no time to waste."</p>

<p>Kennell planted his bulky form squarely in the
Dreadnought Boy's path.</p>

<p>"You'll pass when I get good and ready," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
grated out. "It's time you boys learned a lesson
or two, and I'm going to give it to you!"</p>

<p>"I said let me pass," repeated Ned firmly, making
a determined effort to quell his rising tide of
hot anger at the fellow's evident determination
to provoke him into a quarrel.</p>

<p>"Call me 'sir' when you address me," ordered
Kennell pugnaciously. "I'm going to teach you
how to address your seniors in the service."</p>

<p>"I only say 'sir' to men I respect," was the
sharp retort, the very coolness of which stung
Kennell to renewed fury. His rage was increased
by the fact that a group of sailors, momentarily
growing larger, began to titter at his discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Better leave him alone, Ralph," laughed old
Tom mischievously. "He's as sharp a young file
as I am an old one."</p>

<p>Ned took advantage of the temporary diversion
to try to slip past without trouble. He had
his own ideas of getting even with Kennell, and
it was no part of his plan to break regulations by
getting involved in a fight with him on shipboard.
He stepped forward to pass on.</p>

<p>Kennell was too quick for him.</p>

<p>"Say 'sir'!" he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have already told you for whom I reserved
that distinction," said Ned in a low voice, "and
you are emphatically not in that class."</p>

<p>"Maybe this will teach you respect for your
superiors."</p>

<p>A huge, gnarled fist, knotted and twisted by
many a battle, shook under Ned's nose.</p>

<p>The undismayed boy gave a low laugh of contempt.</p>

<p>"You'd better put that hand to work, instead
of going round trying to scare people with it,"
he said stingingly.</p>

<p>"I will put it to work. SO!"</p>

<p>Wh-oo-oo-f!</p>

<p>The fist fairly whistled as it shot out with
the force of a torpedo speeding on its destructive
way.</p>

<p>But Ned was not in its path. Thrown off
his balance by the boy's quick avoidance of
the sledge-hammer blow, Kennell stumbled forward.</p>

<p>Quick as a whip snap, Ned stepped under his
guard and planted a crushing blow in the fighter's
ribs.</p>

<p>But delivered as it was, with the full force of
the Dreadnought Boy's well-trained muscle, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
seemed hardly to sway the bullock-like frame of
the ship's blusterer.</p>

<p>"I've got the fight of my life on my hands,"
was Ned's quick thought, as Kennell, recovering
himself, prepared, with a confident grin, to annihilate
his young opponent.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">JIU-JITSU VS. MUSCLE.</p>


<p>All else forgotten now, Ned fought warily.</p>

<p>Time and again Kennell rushed at him, apparently
trying to end the battle in a hurry. But
every time he rained his blows on thin air. Ned,
perceiving that his only chance lay in tiring the
man out, had early decided to adopt cautious
tactics.</p>

<p>While avoiding the terrific rushes of his opponent,
however, he still managed once in a while
to land an effective blow.</p>

<p>On Kennell's seasoned body, however, they
seemed to have but little effect.</p>

<p>The jackies groaned in sympathy for the lad
as he put up his plucky and skillful defense. It
was clear that they believed that the battle would
be simply a question of a few minutes, unless it
was cut short by the arrival of an officer.</p>

<p>As the petty officers were at dinner, however,
and the commissioned dignitaries were enjoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
a smoke aft, there seemed little likelihood of any
interference before the contest was ended. The
men were fighting in the shelter of the turret, so
from the bridge nothing of what was transpiring
was visible to the navigating officers or the
quartermasters.</p>

<p>"You young hound, I'm going to kill you!"
hissed Kennell, white with rage, as, for the twentieth
time one of his terrific swings met thin air.</p>

<p>"Catch me first!" mocked Ned, skipping backward
with agile footwork.</p>

<p>Kennell, who was breathing heavily, seemed
fairly to spring at the lad as he spoke, but Ned
nimbly sidestepped, and Kennell went careening
ahead like a man shot out of a suddenly checked
auto.</p>

<p>"Keep your wind to fight with!" advised Ned
jeeringly. But, alas for his confidence, as he
spoke his foot caught on a deck ring he had not
observed, and he fell backward, sprawling.</p>

<p>He was up in a breath, but Kennell, with a
roar of triumph, was on him in a flash.</p>

<p>The bluejacket's great arms, hairy as a bear's,
shot out and encircled Ned in a grip that threatened
to crush his ribs in.</p>

<p>It was a lock grip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned, as the breath was slowly crushed out of
his body, felt as if the fight had ended.</p>

<p>He saw defeat, utter and absolute, staring before
him.</p>

<p>Perhaps this thought gave him almost superhuman
strength, for the next minute, with an
agile twist, he had writhed clear of the deathly
grip and had in his turn laid hold of the bully in
a wrestling clutch.</p>

<p>It was the ancient "grapevine," and Kennell
smiled a cold, deadly smile as he felt and knew the
old school-boy grip. Throwing it off as easily as
if it had been the clutch of an infant, he crouched,
and, rushing in, caught Ned craftily about the
middle; but Ned, slipping aside, gripped the sailor
with a peculiar twist, and seemingly with no
great exertion, shot him over his head.</p>

<p>The tars set up a cautious shout.</p>

<p>It was an old trick of wrestling, in which Ned
was perfectly at home; but, to his amazement,
the agile Kennell fell on his feet as lightly as a
cat, instead of crashing to the deck as Ned had
expected.</p>

<p>The bluejacket, brute though he was, was just
as evidently a master wrestler and up to all the
tricks of the game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, as Ned watched his confident leer as
he recovered from what the boy had expected to
be a crushing overthrow, there was an expression
on the fellow's crafty face that struck a chill that
was almost one of dread into Ned's heart.</p>

<p>As for the jackies, they watched in silent fascination.</p>

<p>Not a sound was to be heard but the quick
"patter-patter" of the wrestlers' feet on the decks
as they "sparred" for a fresh opening.</p>

<p>Suddenly Kennell crouched low, and, before
Ned could check him, was once more upon the
boy.</p>

<p>But now his tactics were wholly changed.</p>

<p>His method of wrestling was unlike any that
Ned had ever seen or heard of.</p>

<p>Yet how deadly it was the boy quickly began
to experience.</p>

<p>Kennell's fingers, spread like the talons of a
hawk, glided here and there about the lad's
body rapidly as the undulating movements of a
snake. Wherever they touched, the boy felt a
sharp shock of intense pain shoot through his
frame.</p>

<p>Beads of cold perspiration jetted out on his
forehead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>A numbing sickness seized hold of him.</p>

<p>And still Kennell's deadly fingers pressed here,
there, and everywhere, bringing the sickening
agony that Ned had already tasted in their
wake.</p>

<p>The very fact that he could not understand
what was happening added to the boy's alarm.</p>

<p>He had been in many wrestling matches. In
fact, he was a better performer on the mat than
with the padded gloves, but in all his experience
he had never met an opponent like Kennell.</p>

<p>Clumsily built as the man was&mdash;he had not an
iota of the agility possessed by the lithe and
supple Ned&mdash;yet he seemed to wind and twist
like a sapling under Ned's holds; recovering from
each grip, he laid his hands on the boy with the
same deadly precision.</p>

<p>Ned began to feel that his nervous system was
a pincushion for his opponent to puncture at will.</p>

<p>The old hiplock, the Nelson, the half-Nelson,
the grip at the back of the neck&mdash;all these tricks
of the wrestler's craft Ned tried in turn, but none
of them seemed to have any effect on Kennell.</p>

<p>And all the time the bluejacket kept up his
deadly assaults on Ned's nerve centers, pressing
them deftly and producing excruciating pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Ned wrenched free, and glad he was of
the brief spell in which he could take stock of his
remaining faculties.</p>

<p>It was not that he was winded, or that Kennell
was too strong for him. In fact, Ned felt that,
well-muscled as the bluejacket was, he had his
own system in better fighting shape.</p>

<p>The strange methods of Kennell were what
worried him. He could not seem to escape the
assaults of those hawklike hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly a partial explanation of the mystery
came to him.</p>

<p>Old Tom stepped forward and whispered in
his ear, during the brief period in which the two
sprang about, eying each other narrowly.</p>

<p>"He's jiu-jitsu! Look out!"</p>

<p>The full meaning of these words shot into
Ned's brain.</p>

<p>He recollected now having heard some talk
about Kennell's having served in the Far East
on his first enlistment.</p>

<p>Doubtless it was there that he had learned the
subtle, deadly Japanese tricks that he was now
exercising on his inexperienced opponent.</p>

<p>Gladly would Ned have come to open boxing.
In a ring, under proper rules, he was well convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
he could whip the burly Kennell; but under
the conditions he now faced, he was by no means
certain of his ultimate chance of victory.</p>

<p>And now Kennell, with his snakelike glide,
closed in again, and Ned seized him without
warning in a half-Nelson.</p>

<p>Back and back bent the bulky form of the bluejacket
till it seemed that his vertebra must crack
under the cruel pressure.</p>

<p>But to Ned's sickened amazement, the other
wriggled from the hold as if he had been some
reptile, and there was the work all to be done
over again.</p>

<p>One fact, however, Ned noticed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>If he was becoming exhausted, Kennell was
also tiring. His breath was coming sharply, with
a hissing intake, like that of a laboring pump.</p>

<p>The strain was telling on him.</p>

<p>Ned felt, if he could only hold out a little longer,
that he would lay his opponent low.</p>

<p>But could he last?</p>

<p>The contest now was simply a matter of brute
endurance plus skill, and in the latter quality Ned
felt that Kennell, in his Oriental way, possessed
the advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly Ned found himself with a grip on
both of Kennell's arms at once.</p>

<p>A flood of joy rushed through his veins. He
felt certain that few men could resist the pressure
he could now exert with his mighty forearms and
biceps.</p>

<p>"Now where are your jiu-jitsu tricks?" he
hissed, as he drew the struggling Kennell nearer
and ever nearer with the same resistless force as
is exerted by the return plunge of a piston.</p>

<p>Kennell, his face white, with an ashy tinge
about the corners of his mouth, said nothing, but
fought with every ounce of strength within him
against the steady pressure that was drawing
him closer and closer into Ned's crushing embrace.</p>

<p>As Ned had said, "Where were his jiu-jitsu
tricks now?"</p>

<p>The breathing of the two men came in short,
sharp barks that sounded hoarsely as coughs as
they stood straining there in a deathlike lock.</p>

<p>For a second or two all motion ceased, and
they stood, except for the working of their opposed
muscles, like two stone figures.</p>

<p>The next instant, however, the slow, irresistible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
force of Ned's compressing arms overcame Kennell's
stubborn resistance, and the bluejacket was
dragged yet nearer into the toils he dreaded&mdash;dreaded
with white, frightened face and beaded
brow.</p>

<p>But even as Ned prepared to throw him with
a mighty crash to the deck, a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>Kennell's body grew limp as a half-filled flour
sack and slid like an inert mass down Ned's body.</p>

<p>The next instant the boy felt his ankles gripped
in a steel-like hold, and, utterly unable to resist,
he was toppled over to the deck. As he fell, one
of Kennell's big hands slid round to the back of
the Dreadnought Boy's neck, and Ned simultaneously
experienced a queer, fainting feeling, as
if he were being borne far away from the <i>Manhattan</i>
and his surroundings, up, far aloft, into
the fleecy clouds.</p>

<p>Again the hand struck, so softly it seemed as if
his neck had been merely stroked, but the sense
of illusion increased.</p>

<p>Ned's eyes closed.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;just as it seemed to the boy that he
was entering a delightful land, where flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
bloomed luxuriantly and birds sang the sweetest
song&mdash;a sharp voice shattered his illusion like a
soap bubble.</p>

<p>"Ned! Ned, old chap! Get him, for the love of
Mike!"</p>

<p>It was the red-headed Herc released from his
cell ahead of time by the captain's commutation
of sentence.</p>

<p>Like a steel spring suddenly released, Ned's
body curved upward, and the next instant the
wily Kennell's body was in his close embrace.</p>

<p>This time Ned had caught him where all his
Oriental tricks were of no avail.</p>

<p>Back and back he bent Kennell till, with a great
gasp, the bluejacket crashed down to the deck,
his head striking with a heavy thud.</p>

<p>"Downed him!" shouted old Tom, capering.</p>

<p>"The kid wins!" yelled the delighted jackies.</p>

<p>Kennell, dazed and astounded at his sudden
loss of the match he had made sure was his, got
clumsily to his feet.</p>

<p>"Shake hands," said Ned simply, extending his
palm. "I don't like you, Kennell, but I think you
are the cleverest wrestler I have ever met."</p>

<p>With a scowl of fury and a half-articulated cry
of rage, Kennell dashed the outstretched hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
from him and hastened away from the jeering
cries of his shipmates, with whom, as has been
said, he was by no means popular.</p>

<p>"Well, if he doesn't care to be friends," remarked
Ned, as the jackies, led by Herc, crowded
around him and shook his hand warmly, "he
doesn't have to. I suppose we shall have to take
the consequences."</p>

<p>What those consequences were to be neither
of the Dreadnought Boys dreamed at that instant.
Perhaps it was as well they did not.</p>

<p>While the congratulations were still going on,
a boatswain's mate came bustling up.</p>

<p>Perhaps he detected the symptoms of something
unusual having occurred in the excited
faces of the jackies and in Ned's still heaving
chest and flushed face, but he was too wise a man
to inquire into something he had not witnessed
with his own eyes. As it was, therefore, he simply
contented himself by inquiring for Kennell.</p>

<p>"With the gun crew," suggested one of the
throng.</p>

<p>"He won't be long," replied the boatswain's
mate shortly and with a meaning look.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked old Tom, the privileged
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because, my boy, he has been relieved from
duty in the forward turret and the two recruits
put there in his place."</p>

<p>"Phew!" whistled the jackies, as the boatswain's
mate hurried forward on his quest.</p>

<p>"Now look out for squalls!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BOYS GET ACQUAINTED WITH BIG GUNS.</p>


<p>Two days later the squadron sighted what at
first seemed&mdash;to the boys, at least&mdash;to be a distant
cloud of deeper blue than the surrounding
sky. It floated on the southern horizon.</p>

<p>"Cuba!" announced old Tom, who, with the
boys, was standing on the fore deck in the "smoke
time" succeeding the jackies' dinner.</p>

<p>"How soon will we come to anchor?" inquired
Herc.</p>

<p>"About sundown," was the reply. "You boys
are in for some strange sights and experiences
down here."</p>

<p>If Tom had been a prophet of old, he could not
have spoken more truly. The boys were indeed
"in for some strange experiences."</p>

<p>That afternoon the gun crews were set to work
on their various pieces of ordnance, and "dummy
drill" was gone through again and again till
the officers were hoarse with shouting commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>In the forward turret, Ned and Herc, the
proudest bluejackets of all the <i>Manhattan's</i> ship's
company, were drilled again and again in their
part of the gun-pointing and sighting performance.</p>

<p>Just as in actual practice&mdash;only these were
dummies&mdash;the projectile, shining and menacing,
and the bags of make-believe smokeless powder
were sent up from the magazines on the electric
ammunition hoists. From these they were rapidly
transferred by the gun crew, who used a sort
of wooden trough in the process.</p>

<p>"Like the hog troughs we put the mash in at
home," mused Herc, as he laid hold of one of
the six handles on the trough and did his best to
fall into the rhythmic swing with which the men
obeyed the sharp series of commands issued by
the officer, who was Lieutenant Timmons himself.</p>

<p>"Take up LOAD!"</p>

<p>The projectile was laid in the trough almost as
fast as it was shot up on the elevator. As the last
echoes of the command rang sharply on the steel
walls of the turret, the implement was reposing
in its "bed."</p>

<p>"Swing LOAD!"</p>

<p>By this time the shining breech&mdash;as fine as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
mechanism of a three-hundred-dollar stop watch&mdash;was
swung open by the breech tender. It was
then only the work of a second to flash the projectile
into the glistening chamber.</p>

<p>"Ram HOME!"</p>

<p>With one quick movement, that seemed to occupy
no longer period than the tick of a clock,
the projectile was slid to its proper place by a
long wooden rammer.</p>

<p>All this time the gun pointer&mdash;Jim Cooper by
name&mdash;alert, watchful as a mousing cat, was
crouched on a little platform at the side of the
gun, sighting an imaginary mark through a telescope
affixed to the gun's side.</p>

<p>The lens of this sight was marked with tiny,
hairlike crosslines, affording the pointer the
means of determining with almost unerring accuracy,
the exact second at which the target and
the gun were in line. In a heavy seaway, of
course, or even in a moderate blow, the work of
the gun pointer is much more complicated, as a
dozen different elements and movements are at
work to confuse and spoil his aim.</p>

<p>Then came the powder charge. Several canvas
bags appeared on the ammunition hoist.</p>

<p>"More like flourbags than powder," thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Herc to himself, as he helped slap them into the
carrying tray.</p>

<p>"Ram HOME!"</p>

<p>The powder was shoved in with the same flash-like
rapidity that had marked the placing of the
huge projectile.</p>

<p>"Ready, sir!"</p>

<p>The chief of the loading crew saluted.</p>

<p>"Ready, Cooper?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Close breech! FIRE!"</p>

<p>The two commands seemed to be merged into
one, so rapidly did they come. The boys and the
rest of the crew sprang to the back of the turret
and crouched low, as did the others as the command
was given.</p>

<p>The gun pointer came last of all, springing
backward like an acrobat. As he did so there was
a sharp click. The lieutenant in command had
thrown the switch that ignited the priming spark.
The mighty charge had been touched off&mdash;in imagination.</p>

<p>The lieutenant looked at his watch, which he
had held on his open palm while the crew worked.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five seconds! Good work," he announced.
"Do as well as that at battle practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
men, and we shall beat the <i>Idaho</i> to rags&mdash;on
speed, at all events."</p>

<p>"And on targets, too," grimly remarked Cooper,
wiping his nervous hands with a bundle of
waste.</p>

<p>This was the final practice of the afternoon,
and the rest of the time was devoted to familiarizing
the two young recruits with their duties
about the turret.</p>

<p>Both were quick pupils and had already studied
something of gunnery at the Newport Training
School, so that in a short time they thoroughly
understood the theory of firing the big guns.</p>

<p>With quick eyes both lads had noticed that the
other twelve-inch gun&mdash;the Varian projectile
hurler&mdash;had not been unhooded, and its grim
breech was swathed mysteriously in waterproof
coverings. It was in the breech that lay the complicated
mechanism which made it possible to
handle the terrific explosive power of Chaosite&mdash;at
least, so the inventor hoped.</p>

<p>As a final lesson, the boys were instructed in
the elementary theory of gun pointing, a much
too technical subject to enter into here.</p>

<p>Herc was amazed when he took his place on
the gun-pointer's little steel platform, to find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
by handling a lever close to his right hand he
could point the ponderous gun, weighing fifty-four
tons, up or down as easily as he used to sight
his little "twenty-two" when he went shooting
"chucks" at home.</p>

<p>"That great gun is balanced as delicately as a
microscope," explained the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"How do you get it in lateral range?" inquired
Herc.</p>

<p>For reply, the lieutenant indicated another
lever.</p>

<p>Herc touched it.</p>

<p>Instantly the great turret itself began to
quake, and then, with a soft rattling of cogs,
commenced slowly to revolve.</p>

<p>"Reverse it!" shouted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Herc pulled the lever in the other direction.</p>

<p>As obediently as if it had understanding, the
tons of triple-riveted steel which composed the
shelter for the heaviest guns in the navy began
to turn in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Electricity," laughed the officer. "Electricity
is the life-blood of the modern battleship. A
vessel like this has a more complicated system of
circulation than the human body. We eat by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
electricity, fire the guns by it, read by it, cook
by it, coal by it, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fight by it, sir," put in Ned quietly, carried
away by enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The lieutenant gave him a quick look, as if to
rebuke him for his forwardness; but the shining
light in the boy's eyes showed the officer that,
after all, it was real enthusiasm for the United
States fighting ships that had incited Ned's remark.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said quietly also, "and fight by it,
too, Strong."</p>

<p>This concluded the great-gun drill, and the
boys and the crew of the forward turret joined
the other tars assembled on the forward deck,
awaiting the sounding of the supper call. All
over the ship, down to the marine's little six-inch
batteries, the same practice had been going forward.</p>

<p>Already they felt set apart somewhat from
their comrades, and proud in the thought that
they were part of the fighting force that commanded
the actions of the biggest guns in the
fleet. That it really did confer a sort of distinction
upon them was evidenced, too, by the increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
cordiality with which their shipmates
greeted them.</p>

<p>"Hurray! we're on our way to be admirals,"
whispered Herc to Ned, as they passed among
the groups of resting jackies, returning the running
fire of joking and congratulation to which
they were subjected on every hand.</p>

<p>"Only a very little way," laughed Ned, "though
I feel as proud as if that was my flagship yonder
and I was entitled to fly the two-starred blue
flag."</p>

<p>He pointed to the van of the squadron&mdash;the
big <i>Connecticut</i>&mdash;on which flew the flag of Rear-Admiral
Gibbons.</p>

<p>"If we do our duty as well as we can," he went
on seriously, "we are just as important to the
fleet as any of the officers or our superiors."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," agreed Herc. "At any
rate, that's just what I heard the captain saying
the other day to two men who had the misfortune
to be my cellmates, and, by the way, that reminds
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herc drew Ned into a quiet niche&mdash;a hard place
to find on the busy, crowded fore deck of the man-o'-war&mdash;and
in whispers told him of the conversation
he had overheard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ought we to tell the captain?" he concluded.</p>

<p>Ned hesitated.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Not yet, at any rate," he
decided after an interval of thought. "We shall
have shore leave at Guantanamo, I understand,
and we will employ it by keeping close on the
track of those two fellows. Neither of them imagine
we know their plans, so that we have that
advantage, and we may be able to do something
that will bring us really in the line for promotion.
I wonder how Kennell got into it, though?"</p>

<p>"I suppose the fact that he was familiar with
the Varian gun, from his detail in the fore turret,
had something to do with their bribing him,"
suggested Herc. "However, we may be on the
eve of finding out."</p>

<p>Destiny was holding big things in reserve for
the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE MIDST OF PEACE.</p>


<p>As the sun was sinking that night in a blaze
of red and gold behind the green-bowered coast
of Cuba, the boys, leaning over the starboard rail
with hundreds of other white-uniformed jackies,
saw a sudden signal broken out on the after signal
halliards of the flagship.</p>

<p>"Coming to an anchorage," exclaimed old
Tom, as the string of gayly colored signal flags
fluttered out. "There's Guantanamo yonder."
He pointed to a huddle of red roofs set among
tall palms.</p>

<p>"The signal's for flying moorings!" exclaimed
Herc, who, as well as Ned, had received a thorough
schooling in signaling at the training school.</p>

<p>"That's right," rejoined old Tom approvingly,
"flying moorings it is."</p>

<p>And now all became activity throughout the
fleet. Aboard the <i>Manhattan</i>, and, indeed, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
every other ship of the squadron, the most active
bustle prevailed.</p>

<p>Coming to "flying moorings" is one of the
greatest tests of a captain's ability to handle his
ship, and right well did every commander in that
squadron of ten mighty fighting ships show that
he was entitled to wear his uniform.</p>

<p>Master's mates flew about among the crew of
the <i>Manhattan</i>, and a shrill sound of piping arose
as the men assigned to the various posts connected
with dropping the vessel's "mud hooks" hastened
to their stations.</p>

<p>"Look close now! You are going to see something
worth watching," said old Tom, as the
crucial moment drew near.</p>

<p>On the flagship ahead the lads saw motion suddenly
cease, following a mighty splash as her
huge anchor shot downward twenty fathoms or
more, and her engines ceased revolving for the
first time in many days.</p>

<p>At the same instant the boys' hands instinctively
flew to their caps in a prompt salute as Old
Glory broke out on the rear-admiral's jackstaff
and fluttered in the evening breeze, a sign that
the ship was at anchor.</p>

<p>On the bridge of the <i>Manhattan</i>, Captain Dunham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
his officers in full uniform at his side and
an attentive midshipman at his elbow, was watching
his flagship anxiously. As she swung to her
anchor a sharp command was barked out:</p>

<p>"Slow down!"</p>

<p>The middy's hand shoved the engine-room telegraph
indicator over, and instantly the strong
vibration of the engines began to diminish. It
felt strange, this sudden cessation of a sound and
motion that the boys had come to regard almost
as second nature.</p>

<p>"Let go the star-bo-ard an-chor!"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!" shouted a watchful boatswain's
mate, springing forward.</p>

<p>Instantly a shrill screeching of whistles broke
out, and with a mighty roar the great anchor of
the <i>Manhattan</i> shot from the cat-heads and
plunged into the water.</p>

<p>After it roared thirty fathoms of chain before
the further screams of the pipes stopped the rapid
"paying out" of the iron-linked cable. The <i>Manhattan</i>,
her engines idle at last, came to an anchorage.</p>

<p>"Caught her to the eighth of an inch, sir!" remarked
Lieutenant-Commander Scott to his chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Sailor-like pride wreathed the faces of every
man on the bridge.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan</i> swung at anchor behind her
flagship at precisely the same distance as she had
steamed in column behind her all the long voyage
from New York. It was a feat to be proud of,
and called for a high degree of seamanship.</p>

<p>Behind the <i>Manhattan</i> the other vessels came
to similar moorings, the Stars and Stripes fluttering
out from the stern staff of each as the
anchor touched the bottom. It was a sight to
make the heart of a patriot beat proudly. Ten
of the finest ships in the United States Navy
swung at exact intervals in a perfect line. The
flag of their country whipped out from the stern
staff of each, as if in defiance of their country's
foes.</p>

<p>Hardly had the anchor of the <i>Iowa</i>, the last
ship in line, dropped before from the flagship
another signal was broken out.</p>

<p>"Well done!" read Ned, studying the bright
bits of bunting. "Congratulations to officers and
men."</p>

<p>A great cheer went up from the fore deck of
the <i>Manhattan</i>, and its echoes went winging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
down the line of grim fighting craft and was
caught up by ship after ship.</p>

<p>At almost the same instant the sun dipped behind
the coast hills, and the bugles began to
sound the musical call of "Retreat."</p>

<p>It was the boys' first opportunity to see the
impressive ceremony of "colors," as the lowering
of the flag on a man-o'-war is termed. The ceremony
is not gone through at sea, and the boys
had been below when it had been carried out in
New York on their first night on board.</p>

<p>Now they were to witness one of the most impressive
ceremonies of the United States Navy.</p>

<p>Division after division of the crew was formed
in line and marched aft, in rhythmic tread, to the
stern deck, on which stood Captain Dunham and
a group of his officers in full uniform, the last
rays of the sun glinting on their gold braid.</p>

<p>The men stood facing the flag and grouped on
each side of the deck. Their hands raised uniformly
in salute to the flag as at the last notes
of the bugle it slowly descended the staff.</p>

<p>As it reached the deck, the band, stationed
with their shining instruments on the starboard
side of the ship, burst forth into the "Star-Spangled
Banner."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The eyes of every man on that deck shone as
the emblem for which they were pledged to fight
fluttered down and the band blared forth the inspiring
strains of the national anthem. Their
officers stood in a little group, bare-headed, the
chaplain conspicuous among them in his plain
braided garb.</p>

<p>"First division, right about face!"</p>

<p>The sharp command of the ensign in charge
of that division broke the impressive silence.</p>

<p>"March!"</p>

<p>Division after division, the men melted away
from the after deck and left the little group of
officers standing chatting alone. In all their after
years in the navy, the two Dreadnought Boys
never forgot that ceremony. Its recollection
remained with them long after the annoying incidents
and trials of their first year of service
had faded.</p>

<p>There were three men in that crew, however,
on whose hearts the solemn scene made no impression.
These men were Carl Schultz, his
friend Silas, and Ralph Kennell.</p>

<p>In the breast of the latter dark feelings of
hatred burned, and a keen sense of humiliation
over his deposition from the forward turret rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
him oblivious to any better feelings. As
the second division, in which all three were stationed,
wheeled to return forward, their eyes met,
and in them there flashed something that seemed
more than a mere gleam of recognition.</p>

<p>Was there actually more in the glance they exchanged
than seemed to be the case? Was it a
mutual sense that they were at the scene which
was to be the theatre of their daring attempt?</p>

<p>We shall see.</p>

<p>As the Dreadnought Boys sat discussing the
ceremony they had witnessed and earnestly talking
over their plans and ambitions, they became
aware that a hush had fallen over the fore deck
and that a group of men were carrying something
aft.</p>

<p>With the other men, they pressed closer to see
what the burden was, and were startled to hear a
sudden groan.</p>

<p>On the stretcher the men carried lay a bronze-faced
jackie, his skin a deadly white under the
brown. Drops of sweat&mdash;the moisture of agony&mdash;jetted
his forehead as he was borne past on
his way to the sick bay, where the surgeon and
his assistants were already prepared to begin a
battle for his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's Bill Hudgins," ran the word among the
jackies. "He was crushed badly when the cable
caught him as we dropped anchor."</p>

<p>Although the boys afterward had the pleasure
of meeting Hudgins and congratulating him
on his recovery, the incident taught them that
even in times of peace there is peril to be faced
on board a man-o'-war, and that it is the duty
of Uncle Sam's fighters to meet it unflinchingly.</p>

<p>After supper that night, while the men were
still discussing poor Hudgins' mishap, the boatswain's
mate&mdash;the same one who had received
them on board&mdash;hastened up to Ned and Herc as
they lay on the fore deck, gazing at the soft tropic
stars, and announced:</p>

<p>"It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good.
Hudgins was signalman of the target officer's
wherry. You boys go out in his place to-morrow."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HERC&mdash;A LIVING TARGET.</p>


<p>To the keen disappointment of the boys, however,
they found out the next day that they were
not, as they had anticipated, to go together in the
target officer's "wherry," as the small boat he
used was called.</p>

<p>Ned was to accompany the officer&mdash;a young ensign
named Rousseau&mdash;while Herc was to take
his place as acting signalman in one of the two
big whale boats that were detailed to attend to
the targets. The man who ordinarily undertook
this duty being assigned to the signal post in the
"flying bridge" of the flagship.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast, the <i>Manhattan</i>,
which was to have sole charge of the target-placing,
lowered the three boats and one of her
"steamers." The targets were set up on the
floats already provided for them before the call
for the first meal of the day sounded.</p>

<p>These targets were huge sheets of canvas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
twenty feet high and twenty-five feet broad,
which were to be towed to a distance of a mile
and a half from the battle-practice ground and
anchored. Each was marked into squares by thin
lines, with a big square of black in the center for
a bull's-eye.</p>

<p>There were ten of them, and they were to be
ranged in a line. The first test to be applied was
firing by the flagship from anchorage. This was
more to get the range than anything else. The
real practice would come later, when the ships in
column steamed past the targets, firing one after
the other at designated marks. This was to be
the real test of the fleet's gunnery, and one in
which the men of the <i>Idaho</i> felt confident they
would again shine preëminent.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan's</i> gun crews, on the contrary,
felt just as sure of capturing the scarlet "meat
ball," the trophy of the fleet.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan's</i> steamer lay, with a full head
of power, alongside the man-o'-war as Ned and
Herc, with their signal flags, emerged from their
quarters forward with the rest of the men assigned
to placing the targets.</p>

<p>The targets, as has been said, had already been
set in place on the big collapsible scows which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
had been towed out from the shore during the
night. Nothing remained but to tow them out
and place them.</p>

<p>The range would then be picked up as soon as
Ned wig-wagged the ensign's signal to the flagship
that all was ready. For this purpose, the
commanders of the different vessels had been
summoned by signal to appear on the <i>Connecticut</i>
that morning and take part in a "counsel of
war" in the rear-admiral's cabin.</p>

<p>As Ned clambered down the sea ladder after
the ensign and took his place in the little boat
he was to occupy, he saw, with a start of surprise,
that among Herc's companions in the
whaleboat were Carl Schultz, the black-browed
Silas, and Kennell. He felt further misgivings
as he took notice of the black glances Kennell
cast at the unconscious Herc, who was far too
engrossed in the excitement of his first real duty
to pay any attention to his shipmates.</p>

<p>Rapidly the boats were towed out to the spot
selected for placing the first target, and Ned,
with a telescope to his eye, anxiously watched
the flagship for the signal to stop.</p>

<p>At last he spied the expected flags fluttering
up on the halliards and notified the ensign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make it so," rejoined that officer, and Ned
rapidly "wig-wagged" that the signal had been
seen and would be carried out. Herc, at the same
moment, was standing in the stern of the whaleboat,
doing the same thing.</p>

<p>The first target anchored, the "steamer" towed
her convoy to the next position, which was indicated
by a signal from the flagship as the first
had been. One after another the targets were
anchored in position, and at last, about an hour
before eight bells&mdash;noon&mdash;everything was ready
for the range testing, and the signal recalling the
steamer fluttered from the flagship.</p>

<p>The whaleboat on which Herc was stationed
was in command of a petty officer, as was the
other small craft. The only commissioned officer
assigned to the comparatively unimportant
duty of target placing was, therefore, the ensign
in the wherry in which Ned was posted as signalman.
In this boat there was but one oarsman;
however, he seemed to be plenty for the craft,
which was a light one and rowed easily.</p>

<p>One after another a final inspection was made
of the targets, and after a thorough overhauling,
all was pronounced ready for the tests to
begin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>To ascertain if all was in order, the ensign had
his boat rowed up to each of the targets in turn.
Ned, at his side, sent the signal that each was
O. K. successively back to the flagship as they
were examined.</p>

<p>"Rather awkward, sir, if they were to fire at a
target while we were standing on the scow," remarked
Ned, as they stood on the undulating
platform supporting the last screen of canvas.</p>

<p>"Well, rather, Strong," laughed the ensign.
"I imagine our earthly troubles would be over
very shortly."</p>

<p>"But if the shell passed above us, sir?" asked
Ned respectfully, as he wanted to accumulate all
the knowledge he could of gunnery.</p>

<p>"The air currents generated by the high velocity
of the shell would sweep anything within
even ten feet of it to destruction," rejoined the
ensign learnedly. "Of course," he added laughingly,
"nobody has ever tested it, but I should
imagine that the gases generated by such a projectile
would poison anything that happened to
be in the vicinity as it passed."</p>

<p>Ned nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>As they regained the wherry he gazed about
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>The sea stretched sparklingly blue under the
tropic skies as far as the eye could reach.</p>

<p>Right ahead of them was extended the line of
snowy targets, seeming huge enough at such close
range, small as they appeared to the battleships
a mile and a quarter off. In spite of the beauty
of the scene and the glorious crispness of the sea
air, Ned felt an oppression, the cause of which
he himself would have found difficult to determine.</p>

<p>"If I was superstitious, I should say that I
had a premon&mdash;a premon&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I forget the
word! But, anyhow, that I had a 'hunch' that
something was going to happen," mused Ned to
himself.</p>

<p>But it was no time for musing.</p>

<p>The whaleboats were beginning to back away
to safe quarters before the firing commenced. At
the ensign's command, the wherry followed them.</p>

<p>"Give them the signal to go ahead, Strong!"
ordered the ensign sharply at length, as they lay
bobbing at some distance from the targets. The
bronzed arms of the oarsman were motionless
and his eyes were fixed intently on the far-off
line of battleships.</p>

<p>Ned stood erect in the stern of the plunging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
wherry. Awkward as the motion would have
been to a landsman, to the Dreadnought Boy it
was hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>His brown arms dipped and rose, and with
their motion the red signal flag cut arcs against
the blue sky.</p>

<p>Far off, on the bridge of the flagship, the lookout,
gazing through his telescope, reported to the
anxious group of officers that all was ready.</p>

<p>Rapidly the word was passed to the port
twelve-inch turret, it having been decided to use
the big guns on test work.</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>The report followed a flash of red flame. The
battleship trembled to her keel plates as the sound
reverberated.</p>

<p>The shell sped screeching through the air.</p>

<p>"Phsiw-is-s-s-s-s-s-s-s!"</p>

<p>Straight for the end target it sped, and a second
later the lookout, reading off Ned's wig-wagging
signals, announced in a curt voice:</p>

<p>"Bull's-eye, sir."</p>

<p>A little chorus of congratulation followed
among the officers.</p>

<p>"That's the stuff!" murmured the ensigns and
middies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Excellent work," was the comment of their
more dignified senior officers.</p>

<p>"Signal whaleboat Number One to replace canvas,"
ordered the ensign, and Ned promptly
transmitted the signal to the boat in which Herc
was signalman. The red-headed lad answered
his chum's signal promptly, and in a minute the
double-ender was scooting through the water on
its errand.</p>

<p>The work of placing fresh canvas on the target
did not consume long, and in a short time
Herc, standing in the stern of the whaler, wig-wagged
back to Ned that all was ready.</p>

<p>"Number One whaleboat signals 'all ready,'
sir," announced Ned.</p>

<p>"Very well. Order them to pull away," said
the ensign.</p>

<p>Ned transmitted the order, and the men who
had been holding the boat to the scow by their
boathooks cast off hastily.</p>

<p>Ned's attention was instantly turned to the
ensign, awaiting fresh orders. Had it not been
for that, he would have seen something transpiring
on the whaleboat which would have filled him
with rage.</p>

<p>Kennell it was who had charge of the stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
boathook. His station was on the small grating
astern of the petty officer's seat. On this grating
Herc, too, was standing. As the boat was
shoved off, Herc felt his feet suddenly twitched
from under him, and the next minute he toppled
headlong into the sea.</p>

<p>The crew of the boat, bending to their oars at
top speed&mdash;for they knew that the deadly projectile
would soon be winging toward them&mdash;apparently
did not see what had occurred, and bent
over their oars without a thought of Herc's peril.
Kennell, with an evil grin on his hard features,
clambered back into the boat with the look on
his face of a man who has done a good day's
work.</p>

<p>At the speed at which the whaleboat was
urged through the water, it was out of earshot
by the time Herc rose to the surface. Indeed,
the unexpected immersion had resulted in his
swallowing so much water that he was unable to
shout.</p>

<p>Blowing a stream of water from his lips, he
struck out for the nearest target, the one which
had just been replaced.</p>

<p>"I'll just camp there till they see me," he
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>A few strokes brought him alongside the float
once more, and he scrambled up its wet sides, not
without some difficulty. In fact, when he gained
the flat upper surface of the target's support he
was breathing heavily.</p>

<p>The sea, too, had risen since they had rowed
out, and one of those sudden squalls that are so
common in the tropics was whirling in from seaward.
Herc did not see this, however&mdash;the
mighty screen of canvas behind him veiled it
from the boy's view.</p>

<p>The men in the boats had, however, spied the
approaching bad weather, and orders were given
to get up spray hoods in the bows of the craft.</p>

<p>"Well," thought Herc, "I'm being rocked in
the cradle of the deep with a vengeance. However,
I get a little rest from that eternal wig-wagging.
That's one comfort."</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck him that sent a cold
shiver down his spine.</p>

<p>In his new-found security he had given no
thought to a peril that now loomed imminent.</p>

<p>He was seated on the float at which the flagship
was firing.</p>

<p>At any moment they might send another shot
toward it, and then what would happen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll signal them," thought Herc; but even as
the thought entered his mind he recollected that
as he had gone overboard the flags had gone
with him.</p>

<p>He was marooned on a floating target, with
every prospect of having a twelve-inch shell come
shrieking toward him at any moment.</p>

<p>Suddenly Herc saw a string of flags hoisted
on the flagship. Instinctively he knew what they
meant.</p>

<p>Ned, his cousin and chum, had signaled that
all was ready, and the <i>Connecticut</i> was about to
open fire!</p>

<p>Situated far to the rear of the target as they
were, Herc knew that those in the boats had not
sighted him, and unless he was missed from the
Number One whaleboat, his doom was sealed.
He could have screamed aloud with real terror at
the peril of his situation.</p>

<p>At almost the same instant his burning eyes
saw a burst of flame suddenly flash from the side
of the battleship. Herc's brain reeled. Already
he could hear the scream of the shell, and in
fancy saw his dismembered body flung in torn
fragments before it.</p>

<p>"Phsiwis-is-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>The projectile shrieked nearer and nearer and
passed like a thunderbolt through the target, ripping
it from top to bottom with a vicious hiss.
It plunged into the sea far beyond, ricocheting
from wave to wave for two miles or more.</p>

<p>But the float was empty of life.</p>

<p>Herc had vanished.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">AFLOAT AND ASHORE.</p>


<p>The petty officer in command of Number One
whaleboat noted the effect of the shot and then
looked about for Herc. As we know, the red-headed
lad was not on board, nor did any inquiry
among the crew bring a satisfactory explanation
of his whereabouts.</p>

<p>The men had seen him standing on the stern,
and then had lost track of him. They had supposed
that he was "somewhere on board," they
said.</p>

<p>Kennell alone volunteered an explanation.</p>

<p>"He may have tumbled overboard, sir," he suggested.
"I saw him standing up in the stern-sheets
as I cast off with my boathook."</p>

<p>"We must communicate with Ensign Rosseau
at once," said the officer, greatly agitated.</p>

<p>He knew that a searching investigation would
follow the loss of a man, and he foresaw that he
would appear in no very creditable light without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
any explanation to offer as to the manner in which
Herc had vanished.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i4large.jpg"><img src="images/i4.jpg" width="400" height="476" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">The triangular fin was now close upon the lad.</div>
</div>

<p>Rapidly the whaleboat was rowed to the
wherry, which "lay to" some distance away, with
the Number Two whaleboat alongside.</p>

<p>The tidings of Herc's loss were received with
some anxiety by the ensign. He turned to Ned,
whose face had gone white at the news, and asked
curtly if Herc could swim.</p>

<p>"Like a fish, sir," was Ned's rejoinder, although
he had hard work to keep his lips from
quivering at the thought of his friend's possible
fate.</p>

<p>"Then there is a chance that he can be saved
yet," breathed the ensign; "give way for that
float yonder. Strong, signal the news to the flagship
and inform them that we are standing by."</p>

<p>Ned, badly unnerved as he was, made the necessary
signals, and received an order to "carry
on" from the flag-ship.</p>

<p>The two whaleboats and the wherry at once
got under way for the target near which Herc
had last been seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned gave a shout and pointed ahead.</p>

<p>"Look, sir, look!" he cried.</p>

<p>Not more than a hundred feet from them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
rubicund object, which a second glance showed
to be Herc's head, was bobbing about on the
waves.</p>

<p>But the water had by this time grown dark
and oily-looking. The approaching squall would
burst in all its fury in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The work of saving the swimming lad must
be accomplished within a brief few minutes, or
not at all.</p>

<p>"Hold on, my lad, we'll get you," hailed the ensign
encouragingly, as the wherry drew closer
and closer to the plucky boy.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," hailed back Herc, expelling a
thin stream of water from his lips and giving a
cheerful grin; "but hurry up, for I've forgotten
my lightning-rod, and it looks like thunder."</p>

<p>But, just as Herc's easy rescue seemed a matter
of certainty, the intentions of his saviors were
interfered with in a startling fashion.</p>

<p>It was Ned who saw the impending peril first.</p>

<p>"Look! Look there!" he shouted. "What's
that, sir?"</p>

<p>"That" was a black, triangular object, moving
through the water toward the unconscious Herc,
who was treading water easily. The dark object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
came on at a rapid pace, the ripples parting
on each side of it as it cut its way along.</p>

<p>The ensign's reply to Ned's exclamation was
a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"Give way!" he shouted. "We've got to get
that man quickly, if at all."</p>

<p>Ned looked his question.</p>

<p>"It's a shark!" shot out the ensign, his face
ashy-white and his lips sternly compressed; "these
waters swarm with them."</p>

<p>Ned was almost unnerved. The boat was still
some feet from Herc, and the triangular fin was
now close upon the lad.</p>

<p>Suddenly its steady motion ceased, and it shot
forward with a rush.</p>

<p>At the same instant Herc perceived his peril,
and gave one harrowing shriek, as he saw the
terrible nature of the approaching peril.</p>

<p>He swam desperately toward the boats, his
countenance strained and lined with the effort
and the horror under which he labored.</p>

<p>"Crack!"</p>

<p>The sharp bark of a service revolver sounded.</p>

<p>"Crack! crack!"</p>

<p>Again and again the reports reverberated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the water behind Herc grew troubled and crimson.</p>

<p>The fin vanished and only a small whirlpool
remained to show where the mortally wounded
shark had sunk slowly downward.</p>

<p>In the stern of the wherry stood Ned, his face
set and stern, and in his hand the navy revolver
that had done the work.</p>

<p>It was the ensign's weapon, which he had laid
on the stern seat for his greater ease in moving
about.</p>

<p>Ned, casting about for some means of saving
Herc, had suddenly spied it, and, on the impulse
of the moment, had snatched it up and fired.</p>

<p>"Well done, my lad," said the ensign in a voice
that still trembled from the keen tension of the
past few minutes.</p>

<p>"Sir&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" began Ned, somewhat alarmed,
now that Herc was out of danger. He had committed
what he knew must be a breach of discipline
in seizing the officer's pistol.</p>

<p>"You mean that it wasn't quite the thing to do
to use my revolver," laughed the ensign. "My
lad, I'm proud that it was put to such good service;
glad that you were quick enough of wit to
use it in the nick of time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>A few moments later Herc was on board the
wherry, and in reply to the eager questions of its
occupants, gave them a brief account of his accident.
He did not mention the fact that it was
Kennell who had tripped him for the second time,
however, saving that for Ned's private ear later
on. Herc had his own ideas about getting even
with the brutal blue-jacket.</p>

<p>"When I saw that nothing could save me from
being 'wiped out,' I stayed on the float," related
Herc. "I recollected that I had felt an iron
brace on its subsurface with my foot, as I clambered
up on to it.</p>

<p>"The minute I saw the signal, therefore, I
dived and hung on to the brace under water till
I felt sure the shell had passed. Then I came
up to the surface, and the rest you know."</p>

<p>"Thanks to your friend Strong, here," amended
the ensign, "whose gallant conduct and presence
of mind I mean to mention especially to Captain
Dunham on our return to the ship. Had it not
been for Strong's quick and sure aim, your adventure
might have had a different termination,
my man."</p>

<p>And now the long-expected squall burst in
leaden-colored fury. To the boys, who had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
witnessed a tropical squall, its rage was amazing.
The flag-ship, which had seen its approach, had
already signaled the recall, and the boats were
on their way back to the <i>Manhattan</i> when the
tempest broke.</p>

<p>"Bale boat!" was the order transmitted
through the little flotilla as the waves began to
come climbing over the bows of the small craft
and torrents of rain invaded them also.</p>

<p>By the time the battleship's side was reached,
however, the squall was over and the sun shining
out brightly once more.</p>

<p>"That's the suddenest thing I ever saw,"
gasped Ned to Herc, as they regained the deck
of their five-million-dollar home, as Herc called
the big Dreadnought.</p>

<p>"It's not half as sudden as what's going to
happen to a young party named Kennell before
very long," grinned Herc meaningly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two nights later there was a brilliant scene at
the Hotel del Gran Plaza, the principal hostelry
of Guantanamo. The mayor and civic dignitaries
of the town, together with the merchants of
the place, were giving a dinner and reception to
the officers of the squadron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>During the time that had elapsed since Herc's
rescue, the Dreadnought Boys had been participating
in their capacity as two of the crew of
the forward turret in battle practice. They had
in that time become used to the big twelve-inch
gun, and proved themselves capable of the responsibility
and confidence vested in them by
their officers.</p>

<p>Well pleased with themselves, therefore, the
two lads had come off the ship that evening for
shore leave. They had employed much of their
time in strolling about, buying souvenirs and
post-cards&mdash;which have even invaded Cuba&mdash;and
seeing the few sights the town had to offer. Being
both temperate, clean-cut young fellows, the
low drinking dens and other resorts of the place
had no attraction for them, although they were
well patronized by a number of the sailors. To
the credit of Uncle Sam's navy, though, be it
said that the keepers of such places are coming
to look less and less to the wearers of naval
uniforms for their profits. The man-o'-warsman
of to-day is an ambitious young fellow. He is
far too anxious to get ahead in his chosen profession
to haunt places of foolish dissipation.</p>

<p>"Say, Ned&mdash;moving pictures!" Herc nudged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
his companion, as the two stood in front of a
brilliantly lighted building on the main street of
the Cuban town.</p>

<p>"We've got some time yet before the shore
boats leave; let's take them in," suggested Ned.</p>

<p>As this was just what Herc had been anxious
to do, no time was lost in buying tickets and securing
two seats well down in front, where the
two boys had a clear view of every film as it was
displayed.</p>

<p>After the exhibition of two or three of the
pictures, stories familiar in such places, the screen
suddenly announced that the next picture was to
be a series of views taken in the Joliet penitentiary,
showing the various phases of convict life.
A note explained that the pictures had been taken
a few years before, prior to the wave of prison
reform that had swept over the country.</p>

<p>The first scene showed the interior of a basket-making
shop, with the rows of stripe-clothed
unfortunates at work on their monotonous tasks.
One after another similar repulsive views were
shown.</p>

<p>"Say, let's get out of this&mdash;the air seems bad,"
breathed Ned at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke a fresh view was thrown on the
screen. It showed a group of life-prisoners at
work in the prison-yard. Unlike the other pictures,
this one exhibited the figures at more than
life-size. In their exaggerated proportions every
form showed up clear as print, and the features
of each hard face could be as clearly defined as if
the pictured subject was a living being.</p>

<p>The boys had risen to leave, but a sudden exclamation
from Herc brought them to a sudden
halt.</p>

<p>Angry murmurs in Spanish rose about the
boys.</p>

<p>"W-what's the matter?" asked Ned in an astonished
voice, gazing about.</p>

<p>"Come on, you chump, and let's get out of here.
We're blocking the views of the Cubanolas, or
whatever they call themselves; but before you go,
look at the two center convicts in that picture.
Who do they remind you of?"</p>

<p>Herc's voice shook with excitement. Ned
gazed a few seconds fixedly at the screen, while
the angry hum of protest increased.</p>

<p>"Seat-a down," came voices.</p>

<p>"By the big horn-spoon, those two wearers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
stripes are Carl Schultz and his pal, Silas, or
I'm a Dutchman," sputtered Ned, as the two boys,
having exhausted the patience of the audience
seated behind them, beat a hasty retreat.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE.</p>


<p>"You are sure of it, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Herc asked the question as they gained the
street.</p>

<p>"Certain," replied Ned; "no mistaking that underhung
jaw and heavy brow of friend Silas."</p>

<p>"Or that lady-like simper of the rascal Schultz.
Ned, I feel that we are on the verge of big discoveries."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; it's in the air&mdash;like electricity."</p>

<p>"Well, they'll have to hurry along&mdash;those big
discoveries of yours, I mean," laughed Ned; "for
it's ten-thirty now, and the shore boats will be
at the float at eleven-thirty."</p>

<p>"That's an hour," responded Herc, "and many
a big battle has been fought and won in that
time. By Hookey!" he broke off suddenly, "did
you see those two fellows who just passed?"</p>

<p>"I saw two rather fleshy men in evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
clothes hurry by in the direction of the hotel.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Did you recognize them?"</p>

<p>Ned laid a hand on Herc's shoulder and
wheeled the red-headed Dreadnought Boy about.</p>

<p>"Say, Herc, what's the matter with you to-night?
You've got rememberitis, or some similar
disease. Who are you going to recognize
next?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; likely to run into Gran'pa Zack,
if this keeps up. Those two fellows were the
same pair of worthies we yanked out of the seats
that day in the subway."</p>

<p>Herc chuckled at the recollection.</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The Pulsifer Gun people. The concern that
sells American-made guns to foreign powers?"</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"As certain as I am that the two figures in that
convict picture were Silas and Schultz."</p>

<p>"If that is the case, we might just trail after
them a little way. There's little danger of their
recognizing us. I don't imagine that they are
here, while the fleet is on battle practice and trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
out new guns, for any good or patriotic purpose."</p>

<p>"That's just my idea. Anyhow, they are going
toward the hotel where all that glare of light
is. As we want to have a peep at the festivities
anyway, we might as well kill two birds with one
stone."</p>

<p>"I agree with you. Come on."</p>

<p>The two Dreadnought Boys wheeled about and
began to follow the course taken by the red-faced,
be-diamonded men they had last encountered so
strangely in New York.</p>

<p>As they had guessed, the pair they were shadowing
went directly to the hotel&mdash;the front of
which bore a brilliantly illuminated set-piece,
formed of hundreds of red, white and blue incandescents,
the whole forming a representation of
the Stars and Stripes. Instinctively the two lads
saluted the colors, and then passed up the broad
wooden steps on to a capacious veranda.</p>

<p>Through windows opening on to it they could
see the long dinner-tables, at which, the meal
concluded, officers and civilians now sat listening
to the more or less complimentary speeches of
the citizens and dignitaries of Guantanamo.</p>

<p>"Looking at the big wigs, eh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys turned.</p>

<p>Behind them stood old Tom. The boys greeted
him warmly.</p>

<p>"Coming down the street? I want to buy a
few gim-cracks for the kids at home."</p>

<p>The lads shook their heads. For reasons of
their own they were anxious to remain about the
hotel till they caught a further glimpse of the
two red-faced men.</p>

<p>"I'll meet you here in half an hour then," suggested
old Tom.</p>

<p>And so it was agreed. The old man-o'-warsman
hurried off and left the boys standing behind
one of the big palms, with which the veranda
was decorated, discussing in low tones their next
move.</p>

<p>But, as things turned out, it was not left to
the boys to determine their actions of the immediate
future.</p>

<p>A door leading from the banquet-room suddenly
opened, and through their leafy screen the
boys spied the two red-faced men emerge. They
were accompanied by a tall, distinguished-looking
man, who wore a Van Dyke beard and was
garbed in evening dress. He was smoking a
cigar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>As the voices of the three fell on their ears,
the boys gave a start.</p>

<p>One of the red-faced men had addressed their
ill-matched companion as "Varian." The boys at
the same instant recognized the inventor of Chaosite
and the untried gun for handling the powerful
explosive, from the picture they had seen of
him in the papers.</p>

<p>Eagerly Ned and Herc listened to catch the
drift of their talk, but the three spoke in
low tones. Suddenly in a heightened voice,
however, one of the red-faced men suggested
that they should seek the garden to smoke
their cigars.</p>

<p>"You will really enjoy seeing the grounds here,
Varian, if you have not done so," said Dave Pulsifer
persuasively; "and under this moon they are
one of the most beautiful sights the tropics have
to offer."</p>

<p>"I should like it above all things, gentlemen,"
responded Varian cordially, "and in the coolness
we can talk over the proposition you say you
have to make."</p>

<p>The three, chatting easily, passed down the
steps and strolled down a smooth path which led
round the corner of the hotel and into the tropical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
gardens, which reached for a considerable
area behind it.</p>

<p>"<i>The proposition you have to make.</i>"</p>

<p>The words rang in Ned's ears.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that Henry Varian, whose
invention was already pledged to the United
States navy, was dealing with one of the foreign
powers represented by the Pulsifers for its purchase?</p>

<p>There was only one way to learn if the navy
was dealing with a traitor. Ned decided in a
flash to adopt it.</p>

<p>"Come on, Herc," he whispered. "We've got
to follow them and hear what they are talking
about."</p>

<p>"But we shall be eavesdropping," objected
Herc.</p>

<p>"Yes; <i>eavesdropping for the flag</i>," snapped
Ned in a low, tense tone, as, with a swift glance
about him, he dropped over the rail of the veranda
and on to the soft ground beneath. He
landed as noiselessly as a cat.</p>

<p>Herc followed him, but was not so successful.
In fact, as he struck the ground with a crash, he
ejaculated:</p>

<p>"Ouch!" in a loud, startled tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily a burst of applause from within, at
some sentiment expressed by one of the speech-makers,
drowned his exclamation. Ned, in an
angry whisper, demanded to know what was
the matter with his red-headed companion.</p>

<p>"Gee whitakers! I dropped into a porcupine,
I think," moaned Herc. "I feel like a human
pin-cushion."</p>

<p>Ned looked at his chum, and then, serious as
was the situation, he could not help breaking into
a low laugh.</p>

<p>"Herc, you poor fellow, I'm sorry for you," he
exclaimed. "You've tumbled into a cactus-bush."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it?" rejoined Herc. "Well, whatever
it is, I can't walk till I get some of these
stickers out of me. You go ahead, Ned, and I'll
meet you here in half an hour when Tom gets
back."</p>

<p>And so it was agreed that Herc was to await
Ned's return and employ the time in extracting
what he called "stickers."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Herc," said Ned, under his breath,
as he slipped off cautiously, avoiding moonlit
spots and dodging along in the black shadows.</p>

<p>"So long," muttered Herc, as he painfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
made toward the hotel steps. "If ever I get these
things out of me," he added to himself, "I'll never
put a tack in any one's chair again. I know just
how it feels now. I'm full of that tack-tus, or
whatever you call it."</p>

<p>With the aid of a grinning colored bell-boy,
Herc soon got rid of most of his "bristles." By
the time old Tom arrived at the appointed meeting-place
he was comparatively comfortable once
more.</p>

<p>"Where's Ned?" demanded the old salt, gazing
about him, as Herc greeted him.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be here in a minute. He just went
off to talk to some old friends&mdash;or rather acquaintances,"
responded Herc lightly. "He'll be
here immediately or sooner."</p>

<p>But Ned was not "here" in a few minutes or
in many minutes.</p>

<p>Impatiently the two&mdash;the Dreadnought Boy
and the old blue-jacket&mdash;awaited his coming, but
the lad did not appear.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck and no Ned.</p>

<p>The quarter past the hour chimed on the hotel
clock and jackies on their way to the boat-landing
began to hurry by.</p>

<p>But of Ned there had been no sign.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A JACKIE AGAINST WOLVES.</p>


<p>Ned, gliding softly as a cat stalking a mouse,
among the trees&mdash;choosing the shady spots to
conceal his movements&mdash;soon came within earshot
of the three men in whose conversation he
was so deeply interested.</p>

<p>The moonlight, as intense as it usually is in the
tropics, flooded the beautiful grounds of the hotel,
making checker-work patterns of black and white
beneath the tropical growth.</p>

<p>The Pulsifers and Mr. Varian were standing
full in the center of a moonlight flooded opening
as the Dreadnought Boy approached them.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Varian," the elder of the two
Pulsifers was saying, "it's sheer madness for a
man in your position to refuse our offer."</p>

<p>"I confess that your knowledge of my 'position,'
as you call it, puzzles me," rejoined the inventor
of the most powerful explosive known,
quizzically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned, crouching low in the dark shadow of a
poinsettia bush, saw the inventor's face in the
flood of silver light, and noted that a smile of
disdain had curled his lips.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Varian," urged the other Pulsifer,
"let's talk as men to a man. You are not
wealthy. You have spent most of what little
fortune you had in perfecting Chaosite, until it
has become, as it is to-day, the most terrible destructive
agent known. As if this were not
enough, you have invented a gun-breech of sufficient
strength and elasticity to withstand the
terrific pressure exerted by the gases liberated
when a charge of your explosive is fired."</p>

<p>The inventor nodded, still in the same mocking
manner, at the flattering tone. He blew a big
cloud of smoke from his cigar, but said nothing.
Obviously he was waiting for the other to go on;
while Pulsifer, for his part, appeared to be expecting
speech of some sort from the inventor.
Disappointed in this, he continued.</p>

<p>"You have, as I said, done all these things&mdash;crowned
your life, I might say&mdash;if I wished to
be florid&mdash;with a magnificent flower of achievement,
and what are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>Pulsifer paused impressively, and came closer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to the unmoved inventor, who stood like a figure
of stone.</p>

<p>"I say, what are you going to do with your
achievement? Fling it away on a notoriously
ungrateful government. Waste it on a navy
which will not repay you a thousandth part of
the sum we are prepared to offer? The power
we represent is apt to become involved in war at
any moment. The situation in Europe is, as you
know, an extremely ticklish one. A spark in
the powder-barrel, and 'Woof!' there is an explosion!"</p>

<p>"What you say may be, and undoubtedly is,
true," remarked Varian coolly, "but was that
what you brought me out here to tell me? You
told me you had important business matters to
discuss&mdash;a proposition to make."</p>

<p>Ned's heart sank. Could it be possible that the
inventor was contemplating the dastardly act of
selling out his country? He listened with eager
attention as the conversation went on.</p>

<p>"Ah, now we are getting down to business,"
smiled the elder Pulsifer amiably; "we did bring
you out here to make a proposition to you, and
one that we flatter ourselves will interest you
deeply."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>Varian bowed gravely, and seemed to wait for
the other to continue.</p>

<p>"If you sell out Uncle Sam, I'll knock you down
if it's the last thing I do," muttered Ned to himself,
clenching his capable fist menacingly.</p>

<p>"You are interested, above all things, in the
success of the Varian type of gun&mdash;handling the
Varian explosive, are you not?"</p>

<p>The elder Pulsifer was doing the talking now.
From his earnest manner things were evidently
coming to a climax.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, that is obvious. It has been,
as you said, my life work. Naturally, I wish to
see its full fruition."</p>

<p>"Exactly; and Pulsifer Brothers are going
to help you. You have heard of Baron Von&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>To Ned's disappointment, the elder Pulsifer's
oily voice sank to a mere whisper, and the lad
could not catch the name the gun manufacturer
breathed.</p>

<p>"Of course, he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is at the present time in Washington. Ah,
Mr. Varian, there is a genius. He is actually
engaged, or reported to be&mdash;it serves his purpose
just as well&mdash;to one of our wealthiest women, and
yet all the time his wonderful mind is plotting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
planning, scheming for his country. Of course,
I tell you this under the pledge of secrecy we exacted
from you before leaving the banquet hall?"</p>

<p>"That goes without saying; but you were going
to remark?"</p>

<p>"That the baron," again the name was omitted,
"came armed with letters to us, and we have
consented to transact this business for him. I
need scarcely tell you, after having promised
this much&mdash;that the baron's mission to this country
is to acquire the formula of Chaosite; and
not only that, but to take back with him the blueprints
and specifications of the Varian breech-block
and explosion-absorbing machinery, without
which the other would be useless."</p>

<p>"The baron is here for that purpose?"</p>

<p>The inventor seemed deeply interested. He
thoughtfully inhaled long puffs of his cigar and
expelled the smoke slowly.</p>

<p>The Pulsifers were watching him narrowly,
without seeming to do so. His attitude, it appeared,
puzzled them as much as it did Ned,
watching from his leafy bower. In the case of
the Dreadnought Boy, however, his mind was
practically made up. Varian was prepared to
sell his secret to a foreign power&mdash;possibly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
use against his own country. He was, or so Ned
judged the situation, only awaiting the naming
of a price.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Varian, I will not conceal anything
from you. We will be perfectly frank," went on
Pulsifer. "The baron is here solely for that
purpose, cleverly as he has masked the object of
his visit. He has declared through the papers
that he is here to study our society and write a
book about it. I need scarcely add that the humorous
interviews with him printed in the New
York dailies&mdash;which have made him appear in a
clownish light&mdash;have aided his plans tremendously."</p>

<p>"How long has this&mdash;this&mdash;baron been here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but a short time. But, as you will have
gathered, he has not let the grass grow under
his feet."</p>

<p>"So it would seem," agreed Varian, with a
curious, dry intonation.</p>

<p>"As I was about to say, Mr. Varian, the government
he represents is a power of the first
class. It has unlimited money at its control. The
financial resources at its command are unquestioned.
The war into which it may shortly be
plunged will undermine its credit, its home prestige<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
and its colonial power if it is not brought to a
successful conclusion. To win that war, which
will be largely an affair of naval engagements,
it will spare no expense to acquire the tools of
victory. The baron, and we also, regard the
Varian gun and Chaosite as an unbeatable combination.
At the trials at the Sandy Hook proving
grounds, the gun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But the trials were secret," protested the
inventor.</p>

<p>"Money will open any door," suavely rejoined
the elder Pulsifer; "it is to our interest to keep
abreast of the times; therefore, we made it our
business to acquire&mdash;I need not insult your intelligence
by saying by what means&mdash;a complete record
of the three-day tests."</p>

<p>"Your enterprise is only equalled by your resourcefulness,"
remarked the inventor. Again
Ned noted in his voice that queer, dry intonation,
as if he were trying to mask some other feeling.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," smiled the elder Pulsifer greasily,
"we are very enterprising, Mr. Varian."</p>

<p>He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a paper.</p>

<p>"Let me read you some of the gun's performances,
and you can judge if I am speaking the
truth or not. On Monday, April the 25th, target<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
at two miles, wind thirty miles, weather clear:
The first shot at nine forty-five scored a bulls-eye;
but, the charge being light, three hundred
pounds only, the projectile did not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," snapped the inventor. "I see that
you had some one there. It is getting late, gentlemen,
and if you will come to the point, I shall
feel vastly obliged."</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed the elder Pulsifer, rubbing his
bediamonded hands till they flashed and sparkled
in the moonlight, "you are as anxious as we to
conclude the negotiations. Well, to put the matter
in a nutshell, Mr. Varian, we are authorized
by the baron to offer you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ned's heart beat so loud and fast that he half-unconsciously
placed his hand over it, as if he
could in that way dull its sound.</p>

<p>"Five hundred thousand dollars for the plans,
specifications and formula."</p>

<p>"Five hundred thousand, why, gentlemen,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a royalty which can be arranged later
to suit your own terms," the younger Pulsifer
hastened to add.</p>

<p>"Look out, Hank Varian," Ned muttered to
himself, as the inventor hesitated, or seemed to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
"you are nearer getting a punch on your nose
right now than you ever were before, you double-dyed
traitor."</p>

<p>"It is a very generous offer," rejoined the inventor,
"but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the Pulsifers interrupted him.</p>

<p>"We are authorized, I may say," added the
elder one, "to make the sum eight hundred thousand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Or more," put in his younger brother.</p>

<p>"Eight hundred thousand dollars," mused the
inventor in a quiet tone; "why, the government
you act for must be made of money."</p>

<p>"They are generous when they have determined
to get a thing," smiled the elder Pulsifer, "and
they have determined to get the Varian inventions.
After all, you see, you can withdraw gracefully
from negotiations with Washington. Nothing
has been actually accomplished yet, and as
matters have only reached an experimental stage
nobody is compromised."</p>

<p>"See here, gentlemen," asked Varian suddenly,
as if his mind had been fixed on this question all
the time Pulsifer had been speaking, "how much
money has this government got to spend in cold
cash?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir, what a question&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Answer me!"</p>

<p>"Well, if you must know&mdash;though it is wholly
foreign to our discussion&mdash;I suppose they could
raise a war fund to-morrow of seventy million
dollars, to be raised by loans to a billion dollars
and a half."</p>

<p>"They could do all this in two days?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"Well, you go back to your baron and tell him
that if his government worked for ninety days
and raised ninety times ninety millions <i>they
would still be a million miles away from buying
Henry Varian to betray his government</i>!"</p>

<p>"You are insane!"</p>

<p>The elder Pulsifer's fat face quivered, while
his brother's already red visage deepened in color
to an angry crimson.</p>

<p>"No; not insane, gentlemen," quietly replied
the inventor. "It is you who must be that for
imagining for a moment that I would set a price
for selling out Uncle Sam."</p>

<p>"Hurray!" breathed Ned from behind his bush;
"it's the Pulsifers I'm aching, twitching, dying
to get a slam at now."</p>

<p>"So, then, you have been trying to draw us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
out!" shouted the elder Pulsifer, beside himself
with fury at the unexpected turn of affairs. "You
have led us on, you cur, you sneak, you hound,
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Smack!</p>

<p>The inventor's palm shot out and struck Pulsifer's
fat face a stinging blow. In the moonlight
Ned could see a dark, angry patch appear where
it had struck.</p>

<p>The younger Pulsifer made a leap for the inventor
as the blow resounded. The Dreadnought
Boy saw something glitter in his hand as he
leaped forward.</p>

<p>It was a revolver that the would-be briber had
drawn.</p>

<p>At the same instant, and just as Ned was about
to spring forward, the elder man drew from his
coat-tail pocket a silver whistle. He placed it
to his lips and blew a shrill blast.</p>

<p>Simultaneously four dark forms leaped from
behind a sort of summer-house shrouded in creepers,
and flung themselves on the inventor.</p>

<p>They bore him to the ground, as the Dreadnought
Boy, with a loud shout of:</p>

<p>"Stand clear!" dashed from his place of concealment.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE PULSIFERS' HANDS.</p>


<p>Sinewy and well-muscled as he was, Ned realized
a moment later that he was in for such a
battle against odds as he had never fought before.
Hardly had he made his unexpected appearance
and bowled the astonished younger Pulsifer
over with a well-directed blow of his fist,
before one of the quartet that had downed Mr.
Varian sprang upon the lad and gripped him in
a strong-armed embrace.</p>

<p>As they swayed back and forth, Ned saw the
fellow's features as the two emerged into a patch
of moonlight. His astonishment almost caused
him to lose his advantageous grip.</p>

<p>"Hank Harkins!" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hank Harkins; and this is the time I
even up old scores," grated the other, through his
close-set teeth.</p>

<p>"Not while I've got two arms," grunted Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
striving to overset the other. But, as he felt
Hank's body bend back and his sinews crack, two
of the other men flung themselves on the Dreadnought
Boy from behind. A few brief seconds
later, Ned, borne down by overwhelming numbers,
was a prisoner.</p>

<p>Even as he fell he recognized the two who
had come to Hank's aid as Carl Schultz and
Ralph Kennell.</p>

<p>"This is the kind of work I should have expected
to find you taking part in," sneered Ned,
as he lay on his back, his arms and legs pinioned
by Hank and Carl Schultz and Kennell's evil face
glaring down into his.</p>

<p>"It's the kind of work you'll have no reason to
like," grinned Hank meaningly. "I fancy that
we'll be able to even up things now."</p>

<p>Ned disdained to answer the fellow, and returned
his threats with a stare of cold contempt.
The next instant he set up a shout, which was instantly
choked back by a rough hand on his
throat. Kennell it was who had compressed the
Dreadnought Boy's windpipe till breathing became
painful.</p>

<p>"Your handkerchief&mdash;quick!" Kennell ordered
Schultz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>The graceful Schultz brought out a scented
piece of linen.</p>

<p>"Now, younker, open your mouth again," ordered
Kennell, taking his hand from Ned's
throat.</p>

<p>Ned set his teeth firmly, however. Kennell,
beside himself with fury, struck him a cowardly
blow across the face with his clenched fist. Still
Ned's mouth was locked.</p>

<p>The blue-jacket, seeing that it would take too
long to force Ned's lips open in that way, then
seized hold of the lad's nose, compressing the nostrils.
In a short time Ned was compelled to open
his mouth to breathe and the handkerchief was
then thrust in between his teeth, making an effectual
gag.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy was then rudely yanked
to his feet. As he stood upright, he noticed a
faint, sickly smell in the air.</p>

<p>Chloroform!</p>

<p>The inventor's figure, white-faced and outstretched
as though in a deep sleep, lay a few
paces away. His stupor showed to what purpose
the drug had been put.</p>

<p>"He'll give us no more bother," grinned Pulsifer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
nodding in the direction of the recumbent
inventor, over whom the scowling Silas stood
guard.</p>

<p>"Got any left for the kid, if he gets mussy?"
inquired Kennell.</p>

<p>"No, confound it," muttered the younger Pulsifer;
"the stuff upset and spilled on the grass."</p>

<p>"I should say it did. The place smells like a
medical college," commented Kennell. "Now,
guv'nor, where's the gasoline gig?"</p>

<p>"Two of you fellows pick up Varian," ordered
Pulsifer, "and follow me. Kennell, you take care
of the boy&mdash;wherever he came from. Tie his
hands. The rig is right outside the rear gate of
the grounds."</p>

<p>Ned, helpless as he was, had no recourse but
to obey Kennell's rough order to "Look alive."
In the meantime the traitorous Silas roped the
lad's hands. In a few minutes they reached the
back gate. Outside it stood a powerful touring
car.</p>

<p>There was a lamp on the rear gate, and Pulsifer,
as he went by, reached up to turn it out.</p>

<p>"The less light we have, the better. No knowing
who is skulking around," he remarked. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
he straightened up to reach the lamp, however,
his eyes fell on Ned, whose face was illumined
momentarily by the light.</p>

<p>Pulsifer gave an exclamation of delight.</p>

<p>"Look who's here, Dave," he cried exultingly;
"little Johnny Fixit. Don't you remember him?"</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed the elder Pulsifer, "that's
one of the rowdy kids who tried to get us out of
our seats on the subway."</p>

<p>"Tried to," thought Ned; "I guess we came
pretty near doing it."</p>

<p>"Oh, this is luck," grinned the younger Pulsifer;
"talk about killing two birds with one stone.
We'll attend to you, my young friend&mdash;you dirty
young spy. We'll put you where what you overheard
to-night will do you no more good than&mdash;this."</p>

<p>He stepped lightly forward and deliberately
struck the Dreadnought Boy an open-handed slap
on the cheek.</p>

<p>Ned's hands struggled with the rope that Kennell
had twisted about his wrists. He palpitated,
ached, and longed with a superhuman intensity,
to get at the younger Pulsifer, and beat his sneering
face into an unrecognizable mass. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
lucky thing for that young man that Kennell
had tied his knots with sailor-like thoroughness.
In a few minutes&mdash;by the time they had been
bundled into the tonneau of the machine, in fact&mdash;Ned
was once more calm. He recognized the
stern necessity for keeping absolutely cool.</p>

<p>On the seat beside him in the tonneau lay
the senseless form of the inventor. As a guard,
Kennell, Schultz and Hank were seated also in
that part of the car. Dave Pulsifer took the
wheel and his brother sat at his side. Silas, the
heavy-browed, occupied the small extension-seat
at the elder Pulsifer's side.</p>

<p>With the engine muffled down, till it made
scarcely any noise, the car glided off into the
night, leaving behind it what Ned could not help
feeling was the last hope of rescue.</p>

<p>As the wheels began to revolve, Dave Pulsifer
leaned back, and, with one hand, extended to
Kennell a revolver.</p>

<p>"If our guests should object to our little surprise
party and moonlight ride, just give them
a leaden pill," he suggested pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Say, guv'nor, it would be pretty dangerous
firing off a gun at this time of night, wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
it? It might bring the alligator-zills, or whatever
they call these Cuban cops, about our ears,
mightn't it?"</p>

<p>The younger Pulsifer laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"No danger of that," he said. "In ten minutes
now we'll be out in a desolate part of the country,
inhabited only by a few cattle-grazers, and
they've got too much horse-sense to inquire into
a casual shot. So don't hesitate to pepper away
if our guests get obstreperous."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the car began to bound
forward, the elder Pulsifer "opening her up," as
they drew out of the few scattered huts on the
outskirts of the town. They emerged into an
arid, stony region, fringed with low, barren hills,
clothed with scanty vegetation. Huge cacti stood
up weirdly, like tombstones in the moonlight,
and a few half-starved cattle plunged off to both
sides of the track as the car sped along.</p>

<p>So far as <i>one</i> of the prisoners becoming obstreperous
was concerned, there was no danger,
or immediate danger, at any rate. Henry Varian
lay like one dead, with his face of a marble whiteness,
in the cold moonlight.</p>

<p>"Say, the guv'nor must have given him a pretty
heavy dose," muttered Kennell, bending over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
inventor and feeling his heart. "I hope he hasn't
overdone it."</p>

<p>"What's the difference?" inquired the soft-voiced
Carl, in a casual way. "We find plendy of
places alretty vere ve get rid off him if he dond
come back."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't care much about taking
such chances," muttered Kennell; "killing a
man is bad business. I should think you and Silas
would realize that, after your escape&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! der boy hear!" warned Schultz, holding
up a thin, white hand.</p>

<p>Kennell subsided with a growl of "what's the
difference," but said no more, to Ned's intense
disappointment.</p>

<p>It was no trick of their eyesight, then, when
the two Dreadnought Boys had recognized in the
two pictured convicts, at the biograph exhibition,
their two dastardly shipmates. Moreover, it
seemed, from what Kennell had let drop, that
both men were jail-breakers. Revolving this in
his mind, Ned saw the cunningness of the two
men's movements, if they had actually escaped
from Joliet. What less likely place to find an escaped
prisoner than in the United States navy?
They must have forged papers of recommendation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
and character, and thus tricked the careful
authorities. In fact, Ned learned later that this
was the case.</p>

<p>On and on droned the car, speeding through
the same monotonous moonlit wastes of hills and
scrub-grass&mdash;with here and there the gaunt form
of a tall royal palm&mdash;as it had encountered on
leaving the scattered outskirts of the town. All
the time Ned had been working feverishly, but
quietly, at his bonds, and now he began to feel
what at first he scarcely dared believe&mdash;the ropes
were becoming slightly loosened. In ten minutes
more he had stretched the new rope, of which the
thongs were made, till he could slip them off by
dint of rubbing them against the cushion at his
back.</p>

<p>His mind was made up as to what he would
do the instant he found himself at liberty to make
his escape. He would drop from the car and
trust to luck to get away. The surface of the
hills was rough and creased with numerous deep
gullies. If he could get into one of these, it
would be impossible for the auto to follow, and
on foot&mdash;well, Ned had a few records for sprinting
behind him, and he was confident he could
outdistance any one of the occupants of the car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked about him. The car was at this
moment passing quite near to one of the arroyos&mdash;as
they are called in our West&mdash;that Ned had
noted. Kennell, his eyes half-closed, was hunched
in a doze, the pistol in his lap. Carl Schultz
and Hank Harkins were talking in low tones.
Not a single one of them was watching the
Dreadnought Boy.</p>

<p>The moment to carry out his plan, if he was to
put it into execution at all, had arrived.</p>

<p>With a quick move, Ned slipped off his thongs,
and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>Before any one of the occupants of the tonneau
knew what was happening he was out
of the auto and sprinting, as he had never
sprinted before for the friendly darkness of the
gully.</p>

<p>Angry shouts instantly broke out. The gully
seemed farther than Ned had judged.</p>

<p>He had gained its edge, and, with a grateful
prayer, was about to slide over into security,
when he felt a sharp twinge in his right calf.
At the same moment he heard the sharp crack of
a revolver behind him.</p>

<p>Nobody had ever accused Kennell of being a
bad shot, and he had aimed true this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned doubled up.</p>

<p>He was halted by unbearable pain. In another
instant his pursuers had seized him with
exulting cries.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THREE MINUTES OF LIFE.</p>


<p>Before the first sharp sting of the wound that
had halted the Dreadnought Boy had subsided,
Ned found himself once more a prisoner. He
had torn the gag from his mouth as he ran; but
he made no effort to shout, knowing that it would
do no good in that desolate region. He calmly
submitted to being rebound, this time his legs
also being tied tightly.</p>

<p>"We'll take no further chances with you, my
young rooster," commented Kennell, as he made
a double half-hitch on Ned's leg thongs; "but you
were a greeny to think you could get away as
long as Ralph Kennell could hold a gun."</p>

<p>Although the wound in his leg gave him acute
pain, Ned was pretty sure it was only a flesh one,
and had not shattered the bone; for which he
felt thankful. Ned was made of that kind of
stuff that never gives up hope, and, even in the
desperate position in which he now was, he yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
decided to make the best of it and watch for any
chance that might present itself to extricate himself.</p>

<p>"Come on, come on," growled the elder Pulsifer,
as Ned was once more hustled roughly into
the tonneau of the machine. "We can't waste all
night on that cub. Silas and Carl told us that
you were a good fast worker. We're not paying
you to take all night over it."</p>

<p>"All right, guv'nor; keep your shirt on," rejoined
Kennell; "let her rip. We've got him hog-tied
now, all right."</p>

<p>Not long after, the auto shot into a dark,
shadowed cañon, which seemed to bisect the
range of rugged hills, and came to a halt on the
other side. The stop was made before a small
house, built in the native style, in front of which
stood a row of royal palms.</p>

<p>"Home, sweet home," grinned Kennell, with
grim humor; "come on, younker, pile out, there."</p>

<p>Ned almost yelled with pain as he straightened
up on his injured leg, and Kennell, noticing him
wince, gave a loud, brutal laugh.</p>

<p>"Hamstrung, by the great bow-gun!" he exclaimed.
"I guess you'll give us no more
trouble."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>To Ned's relief, for he had almost begun to
share Kennell's belief that Varian had been over-drugged,
the inventor had opened his eyes a few
moments before they reached the hut, and murmured
feebly. His words lacked sense, however,
under the influence of the drug as he still was.</p>

<p>"Bring them both into the front room," ordered
the elder Pulsifer, as he climbed down from
the driver's seat.</p>

<p>The "front room," it transpired, was a sparsely
furnished apartment, containing a table and two
or three chairs, and nothing else. The floors
were bare and of polished wood after the manner
of the country. Ned guessed that the place
was occupied only temporarily by the Pulsifers
as a quiet spot in which they could meet their
agents, secure from outside observation. The
fact that they had brought an auto to this part of
Cuba, where horses are mostly used, lent color
to this supposition.</p>

<p>Dave Pulsifer's first act was to light a lamp,
which he placed on the table; his second, to ignite
a cigar, and his next to offer a chair to the
white and shaky inventor.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Varian," he said. "We don't wish
to injure you, or hurt you unless we have to;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
but, as you wouldn't talk business over quietly,
we have had to adopt these means of bringing
you to terms."</p>

<p>Glad enough of a chance to rest, Mr. Varian
slipped wearily into the offered chair. Ned was
shoved along by Kennell till he stood behind the
inventor with Kennell close at his elbow. Since
his frustrated escape, the wretches who held him
captive were taking no chances of another runaway.</p>

<p>Schultz, Silas, and Hank Harkins stood behind
the younger Pulsifer, who had now joined his
brother at the opposite side of the table to that at
which Mr. Varian's chair had been placed. Before
the younger of the worthy pair of brothers
lay a revolver convenient to his hand. As he
regarded Mr. Varian intently, his jeweled fingers
played with its butt suggestively.</p>

<p>The inventor made no reply to the elder Pulsifer's
remarks, and the foreign agent&mdash;as he now
stood revealed&mdash;continued in a sharp tone. This
time he came right to the point.</p>

<p>"Varian, we need not beat about the bush
now. We want those plans and the formula."</p>

<p>"I have not got them," replied the inventor, in
a low, shaky voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"You lie!"</p>

<p>It was a sure indication of Mr. Varian's pitiable
condition that he made no move or spoke
no word at the insult.</p>

<p>"You searched my pockets before you forced
that stuff over my face," he breathed. "You
know that I have not got them."</p>

<p>"Again I say you lie. You were consulting
with Captain Dunham, of the Dreadnought <i>Manhattan</i>,
earlier this evening. You were seen to
show him the papers, and explain some of the
points of the test which is to be made of your
gun shortly. Come, we don't want to be unnecessarily
rough with you. Are you going to give
the papers up?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The answer snapped out like the crack of a
whip.</p>

<p>Ned noted with satisfaction that the inventor's
former fire and decision seemed to be returning.</p>

<p>"Then we must search you. Men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The elder Pulsifer pointed to the inventor,
while the younger covered him with the revolver.
One of the latter's bediamonded fingers was
crooked on the trigger as if he longed to pull it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly Carl Schultz, Silas and Hank, who
had all three started forward at the command,
seized and held Mr. Varian tightly, while the
younger Pulsifer, still with his revolver in hand,
tapped the inventor's coat to find the hiding-place
of the papers.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed suddenly, with a cry of
triumph. A crisp, crackling sound had rewarded
his search.</p>

<p>An instant later, from a secret pocket in the
inventor's coat, he had drawn forth a flat bundle
of papers. The two Pulsifers, their eyes shining
greedily, scanned them closely beneath the lamp,
and then uttered what was a perfect howl of baffled
rage.</p>

<p>The blueprints of the breech-block, without
which the gun would be useless and the formula
so much waste-paper, were not there.</p>

<p>"Look here, Varian," snarled the elder Pulsifer,
"we've been pretty lenient with you, so far.
We intend to be so no longer. Where are those
blueprints?"</p>

<p>"Where you will never get them," bravely replied
the inventor.</p>

<p>"You are overconfident, my friend," sneered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the elder Pulsifer. "We not only will get them,
but by your own lips you will tell us where to go
to acquire them."</p>

<p>If the faces of the Pulsifers had borne an evil
look before, they became as avid as those of
vultures now.</p>

<p>The inventor, who was fast overcoming the
effects of the drug, folded his arms defiantly,
his captors having released him when the search
was given up by the younger Pulsifer.</p>

<p>"Bind him!"</p>

<p>The command was snapped out by the elder
of the brothers.</p>

<p>Instantly the three hired rascals who had held
him before pounced on the inventor, and roped
him tightly in the chair.</p>

<p>Resistance was useless, and the inventor submitted
to the ordeal with an unflinching countenance.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Varian, have you changed your
mind?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; and I never shall if you wish to
know, Dave Pulsifer."</p>

<p>"Very well. We have tried fair means, now
we'll adopt other tactics."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pulsifers whispered together a few minutes,
and then the younger brother left the room.</p>

<p>He returned with a fair-sized keg, which
seemed to be heavy. This he placed in a corner
of the room.</p>

<p>"What on earth are they going to do?" Ned
wondered to himself.</p>

<p>He was not to be left long in doubt.</p>

<p>The younger Pulsifer's next move was to open
a cupboard in one corner of the room and produce
a short length of candle.</p>

<p>He eyed this critically and then produced a
silver match-box.</p>

<p>A tense silence hung over the room, as the
flabby-faced Pulsifer moved about making these
preparations. Both Mr. Varian and Ned eyed
him with close attention. They felt that somehow
or other, incomprehensible as these preparations
were, that they boded no good to themselves.</p>

<p>The younger Pulsifer lit the candle and then
turned to the two captives with a smile.</p>

<p>"This candle will burn, roughly speaking, for
five minutes," he said. "I am going to place it
in this barrel of powder. The stuff is not as
powerful as Chaosite, but it will serve the purpose,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
he added, with a side glance at the inventor.</p>

<p>As he spoke, the wretch ripped off the wooden
heading of the barrel, which had already been
loosened, and placed the candle upright on its
contents.</p>

<p>This done, he once more turned to the inventor.</p>

<p>"<i>Now</i>, will you tell us where those blueprints
are, and give us an order for them?" he snarled.</p>

<p>"Not in the longest day you ever lived," replied
the inventor firmly.</p>

<p>"Good for you," shouted Ned; "if we are to go
to the bottom we'll go down with colors flying,
Mr. Varian."</p>

<p>"That's right, my boy; spoken like a true jackie
of Uncle Sam," said the inventor approvingly.</p>

<p>"Very fine, heroic and melodramatic," sneered
Dave Pulsifer, "but think a moment, Henry Varian.
That candle is getting shorter. In a few
seconds we shall withdraw, not wishing to be
present at the final act of the tragedy. Think of
your wife and children&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time the inventor groaned, but an instant
later recovered himself.</p>

<p>"I would rather leave them the memory of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
loyal citizen and American, than give them the
companionship of a coward and a traitor," he replied.</p>

<p>"More heroics; really, Varian, if you were going
to live, you might tackle a melodrama with
good success. Come on, boys. Two minutes of
time are up. In three minutes more this place
and those in it will be blown to pieces. Good-night
and&mdash;good-by, Varian, and you too, you
spying, sneaking, informing cub. If you relent,
Varian, shout loud, and we shall hear you."</p>

<p>With this bitter fling at the Dreadnought Boy,
the Pulsifers and their evil companions withdrew,
Hank Harkins pausing at the door to remark:</p>

<p>"I guess I'm on top now, Ned Strong."</p>

<p>Ned disdained to reply, but, instead, as the
door closed behind the men who had planned such
a refinement of cruelty, he fixed his eyes on the
candle in the barrel. Pulsifer had taken the lamp
when he and the others withdrew. The light of
the waxen illuminant, that was rapidly growing
shorter and nearer to the powder, was the only
radiance in the room.</p>

<p>"In three minutes," Pulsifer had said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned's eyes regarded the flickering candle with
a look of despair.</p>

<p>It grew lower and flickered. One more such
wavering of its steady flame and the end must
come.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BLUFF CALLED.</p>


<p>Ned cast his eyes despairingly this way and
that, in the hope of spying something that might
promise even a faint hope of salvation.</p>

<p>"Ned," it was the inventor's voice; but it sounded
faint and far off, "shall I call out?"</p>

<p>"And betray your trust&mdash;no, sir!"</p>

<p>"Thank you; I thought you would say that.
There is no chance of our getting away?"</p>

<p>"Not a loophole that I can see, sir."</p>

<p>"So be it. The explosion must come in a few
seconds now, and all will be over."</p>

<p>The inventor bowed his head. Ned's brain
worked as it had never worked before, but, think
as he would, he could not contrive any avenue of
escape. "If only I could work these ropes loose;
if only they'd left the lamp&mdash;I'd have risked
knocking it over and burning them off. If only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The boy came to a sudden stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>On the floor by the table he had espied a small,
gleaming point of fire&mdash;the burning stub of a
cigar, carelessly thrown aside by one of the Pulsifers.
They smoked only the best of cigars and
the weed burned red and strong.</p>

<p>To Ned its spark rekindled hope.</p>

<p>That tiny glow meant perhaps life and freedom.</p>

<p>Without an instant's delay, he threw himself
on the floor, for, bound as he was, he could not
bend or move. Otherwise he would have taken
a chance on burning through his thongs at the
candle in the powder keg.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy rolled himself toward
the burning cigar butt. Mr. Varian watched
him wonderingly, but made no comment. He
realized that the boy had found what he thought
was a way of escape.</p>

<p>Ned placed his mouth alongside the cigar, and
after some difficulty got it between his teeth. He
took a few sharp puffs, as he had seen smokers
do, although the rank taste of the tobacco sickened
him. It was Ned's first and last smoke.</p>

<p>With the end of the cigar now blazing redly,
he was ready for the next step. Dropping the
"weed," he wriggled along the floor till he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
brought his bound wrists up to the red end.
Then he pressed the rope down on the glowing
tobacco, with a silent prayer that he might be in
time.</p>

<p>A smell of burning rope filled the air.</p>

<p>A second later Ned Strong, his hands free,
uttered a low cry of triumph.</p>

<p>He had won the first step of the desperate
fight for liberty.</p>

<p>Rapidly, with his freed hands, he felt in his
pockets. His captors had forgotten&mdash;or, as was
more probable, had not deemed it worth while&mdash;to
search him. His jackknife was in his pocket.
To sever his leg bonds was the work of two
quick slashes. In his excitement the pain of his
leg was forgotten. All that the Dreadnought
Boy knew was that he had a fighting chance.</p>

<p>Hastily he stepped up to the powder barrel
and prepared to pluck out the candle. This was
risky work. Not only might the Pulsifers or
some of their gang be on the lookout, but he
might, in his haste, spill a spark which would
blow both himself and the inventor sky high.</p>

<p>As he reached the side of the keg, however,
Ned's first utterance was a gasp of surprise and
then a low laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bluffed!"</p>

<p>The exclamation came sharply as he plucked
out the candle and threw it to the floor. Luckily
it did not go out, for the next instant he realized
that he would have to use its light.</p>

<p>Hastily he made his way to the inventor's
side. A few quick slashes of the knife, and Mr.
Varian stood free, words of gratitude on his lips
and a light of admiration in his eyes.</p>

<p>Ned hastily checked the other's words.</p>

<p>"Time for action now, sir," he said briskly.
"Can you run an auto?"</p>

<p>"Can you tie a running bowline?" smiled the
inventor, who now seemed as cool as ice.</p>

<p>Ned grinned appreciatively.</p>

<p>If all went well, the next step of his hastily
contrived plan of escape could be carried out.</p>

<p>"One moment, sir," begged Ned, as the inventor
whispered: "What next?"</p>

<p>The boy was over at the side of the keg and
rummaging there, it seemed.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't waste time on that,
my lad," urged the inventor. "Let us make
a dash for it. Those men may be near at
hand."</p>

<p>"All in good time, sir; but I want to cinch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
these rascals if we can and cinch them good and
tight!"</p>

<p>"But why waste time on that powder barrel?"</p>

<p>"Powder barrel nothing&mdash;&mdash; I mean, it's not
a powder barrel, sir."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That's right. Look here!"</p>

<p>Ned held up a handful of papers which he had
extracted from the keg.</p>

<p>"When I said 'bluffed' just now, that's what I
meant. But, Mr. Varian, we've called their bluff
with these!"</p>

<p>"These" were papers which seemed to be maps
of different places carefully marked and figured,
and other diagrams of different kinds.</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"As well as I can see, sir, material to forge
steel chains on those rascals who brought us
here. They appear to be plans of United States
ports and details of our harbor defenses. But
we've no time to look them over now. Come,
sir!"</p>

<p>The lad stuffed the papers in his blouse.</p>

<p>He had noticed with his keen eyes that few
things escaped, that the Pulsifers had not locked
the front door when they entered their hut. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
now flung it open, and, a second later, he and
the inventor stood under the open starlight, their
hearts leaping excitedly.</p>

<p>In front of the door, a dark shadow in the
gloom that had set in following the sinking of
the moon, was the automobile.</p>

<p>A little gasoline, and more than a little good
luck, was all that lay between them and safety.</p>

<p>"Crank her up, sir. I'll stand guard here,"
breathed Ned.</p>

<p>The inventor bent over the front of the machine
and jerked the cranking handle over.
There was no explosion.</p>

<p>Again he turned it, without result.</p>

<p>"We'll have to hurry, sir, or else run for it,"
warned Ned. "Hark!"</p>

<p>Inside the house they could hear trampling of
feet.</p>

<p>Evidently Pulsifer and his brother had decided
that their "bluff" would have burned itself
out by this time, and were returning to the room
in which they confidently supposed their helpless
victims were lying in agony of mind.</p>

<p>"We'll have to try them another way, since
they have withstood the ordeal of powder," Ned
heard the elder Pulsifer's heavy voice boom out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
half-amusedly, as the inner door of the room
banged open.</p>

<p>At the same instant there came a low "chug"
from the motor.</p>

<p>"Speed up that spark," ordered the laboring
inventor. "No, not that lever. There, that little
attachment on the wheel. That's it."</p>

<p>Chug-chug-chug!</p>

<p>"Hurray! that did the trick!" shouted Mr.
Varian, forgetting his dignity in the excitement
of the moment.</p>

<p>As he spoke, from inside the house they heard,
above the roar of the now awakened motor, the
shouts of dismay with which Pulsifer and his
mercenaries greeted their discovery that their
"birds had flown."</p>

<p>"They can't be far off!" Ned heard the heavy
voice boom out. "Scatter, boys! After them!
One hundred dollars to the lad who bags the first
one!"</p>

<p>The front door burst open and out rushed the
men who a few minutes ago had been so confident
of bluffing out one of Uncle Sam's sailors
and one of his brainiest citizens.</p>

<p>"There they are!" yelled Pulsifer, as his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
lit on the two figures as they lightly swung into
the auto. "Don't let them get away! Five hundred
dollars if you stop them!"</p>

<p>"Shoot 'em down!" bawled the shrill tones of
Schultz.</p>

<p>As the inventor opened up the motor and
threw in the clutch several dark figures leaped
in front of the machine, and one jumped on to
the seat beside Ned.</p>

<p>This last figure&mdash;it was that of Kennell&mdash;raised
a knife high and then brought it down
with a vicious swoop. The blade seemed to
strike full at Ned's heart.</p>

<p>The inventor gave a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>But at the same instant, like a thing instinct
with life, the car leaped forward.</p>

<p>"Stand from under!" bawled the inventor, as
he threw in the third-speed clutch.</p>

<p>Ned saw the figures of Schultz and Hank Harkins
flung aside by the wheels and go rolling
down the steep hillside. At the same time he
drew back his fist and sent it crashing into Kennell's
face. The knife fell clattering twenty feet
away, as the treacherous bluejacket, with a howl
of alarm, fell backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take that from Herc Taylor!" shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Forward into the darkness plunged the car,
leaping and rolling over the rough road.</p>

<p>"Hurt, Ned?"</p>

<p>It was the inventor speaking. His voice was
anxious. Already the shouts and cries behind
them were dying out.</p>

<p>"No, sir, why?"</p>

<p>"That blow with the knife. I thought it
would have killed you."</p>

<p>"Well, it might have, sir, but for <i>this</i>. I carried
it for a luck piece, and I guess it's earned
its name!"</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy held up a tiny silver
coin. It had a big dent in it, where Kennell's
blade had been turned.</p>

<p>It was old Zack's parting present, the Canadian
dime.</p>

the men you suspected, and that was the last you
saw of him?"</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral Gibbons, Captain Dunham and
several other officers were seated in a room on
the lower floor of the hotel at which the banquet
that had ended so disastrously for the inventor,
Varian, had taken place.</p>

<p>Herc shifted uneasily on his feet. He felt
alarmed before this glittering court of inquiry
that had convened as soon as it became apparent
that the absence of Henry Varian, discovered
shortly before midnight, was no mere accident.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he replied to Captain Dunham, who
had put the question.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible that the man Strong was in
league with the miscreants? The circumstances
seem very suspicious," put in the rear-admiral.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said Captain Dunham, "that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
shall find, when the mysterious affair is sifted,
that young Strong acted the part of a United
States sailor in the matter. I have kept a careful
eye on him, and should be loath to believe
him anything else than an upright, honest young
fellow of uncommon capability."</p>

<p>"Good for you," thought Herc to himself.</p>

<p>"And what were you doing all this time?"
inquired one of the officers of the embarrassed
witness.</p>

<p>"Picking stickers out of myself, sir."</p>

<p>"What! Be careful, young man; this is no
time for levity."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I guess if you had fallen into a
tack-tus bush you'd have been picking those vegetable
tenpenny nails out of your system for a
while, too," replied Herc in an aggrieved tone,
while suspicious twitches appeared about the corners
of the mouths of several of the assembly.
Rear-Admiral Gibbons got up and gazed out of
the window for a moment to conceal his smiles
at the naïve rejoinder of the red-headed youth.</p>

<p>Suddenly he turned, with a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he exclaimed, "here comes the
automobile, or one just like it, that those two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
precious rascals, the Pulsifers, used. I've seen
it before. As it was the only one in Guantanamo,
I remarked it especially."</p>

<p>The officers crowded to the window, and Herc
would have joined them, but a marine barred
his way.</p>

<p>"Get back, young feller," he warned, suggestively
pointing his bayonet.</p>

<p>"Huh! I guess you never had a friend in
trouble," grunted Herc, going back to his witness
chair in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>But the auto, instead of coming up to the hotel,
turned off two blocks below.</p>

<p>"Possibly I was mistaken," said the admiral.
"Those two figures in it didn't look like the two
scoundrels, but at the distance it is impossible to
tell."</p>

<p>"In any event, sir, they cannot escape from
Cuba," spoke up one of the officers. "Every port
has been telegraphed. Their capture is almost
certain."</p>

<p>This was indeed the case. An investigation
of the garden had shown clear indications of the
struggle that had taken place there the night
before, and servants had been discovered who
had seen the inventor issuing into the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
with the unsavory Pulsifers. The odor of chloroform
still clinging to the grass decided the matter,
and completed the chain of circumstantial
evidence. Herc, too, had been able to supplement
the mute testimony by his story of the convict
film and the names of the conspirators. Already
a launch full of marines had been sent to
Boco del Toros to intercept the yacht Carl and
Silas had mentioned in the lad's hearing.</p>

<p>This much having been done, a code message
had been sent to the secretary of the navy, who
had at once ordered every port in Cuba watched,
and detailed secret service men in the United
States to special duty to apprehend the Pulsifers
if they attempted to land in America.</p>

<p>The examination of Herc, who was, of course,
the principal witness, went on.</p>

<p>At its conclusion an officer of the <i>Illinois</i>
begged permission to ask one more question.</p>

<p>"My man, did you or your friend talk over
this step of his?"</p>

<p>"Not any more than I have told you, sir," rejoined
Herc, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>"I submit, sir," remarked the officer, turning
to the rear-admiral, "this looks somewhat as if
the lad was in league with the Pulsifers. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
know now, from what this lad has told us, that
other members of the crew were disaffected; possibly
Strong was bribed, too."</p>

<p>"You don't know Ned Strong, sir," spoke up
Herc, "or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence, sir!" thundered the officer.</p>

<p>"Huh!" grunted Herc, in a low tone, however.</p>

<p>"As I was saying, sir, the whole thing looks,
as you said, suspicious. We know that the lad
was recently placed in the forward turret of the
<i>Manhattan</i>, and would have had an opportunity
to examine the breechblock of the Varian gun.
He might even have made rough drawings of
it."</p>

<p>"What you say is plausible, Captain Stirling,"
nodded the rear-admiral gravely.</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it!" snapped Captain
Dunham hotly. "I'll stake a good deal on
that youngster's honesty, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll win!" came a crisp voice from the rear
of the room.</p>

<p>The officers turned, amazed, and set up a shout
of astonishment as they beheld, framed in the
door which they had entered noiselessly, the figures
of the inventor, and, standing, cap in hand,
by his side, the Dreadnought Boy, the lad to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
whose pluck and resourcefulness the inventor
largely owed his liberty.</p>

<p>"I repeat it, gentlemen," went on the inventor,
for it was he who had voiced the interruption;
"there isn't a finer, more capable or grittier lad
in the service to-day than Ned Strong of the
<i>Manhattan</i>."</p>

<p>"But, but&mdash;gentlemen, pray sit down&mdash;&mdash;" began
the rear-admiral. "Really this is most irregular."</p>

<p>He sat down resignedly as the officers pressed
about the inventor and Ned. In a few moments
order was restored, and the two newly escaped
captives were telling their story.</p>

<p>"But how did you get back from the Sierra
Madre Mountains so quickly?" asked Captain
Dunham, who was familiar with Cuba and had
recognized the location of the Pulsifers' hut from
the inventor's description.</p>

<p>"Let Ned Strong tell that," smiled the inventor.</p>

<p>"Why, gentlemen, we&mdash;we borrowed Mr. Pulsifer's
automobile," explained the Dreadnought
Boy.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" burst out Herc, who had been
dancing about in the background, hardly able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
to keep down his excitement. Of course, discipline
did not permit his greeting Ned just then,
and he had been on the point of exploding ever
since his chum entered the room.</p>

<p>In the general excitement no one reproved the
impulsive youth, who turned as red as a winter
sunset when he realized what a sad breach of
naval etiquette he had committed.</p>

<p>"Strong, stand forward," ordered Rear-Admiral
Gibbons, as the inventor took up and concluded
the story of how they had missed their
road, but finally found their way into town, going
first to a house occupied by some friends of
Mr. Varian's before proceeding to the hotel. At
the home of the inventor's friends they had got
a wash and brush-up which both stood sadly in
need of. Ned's leg, besides, had required dressing.
It turned out to be, as he had guessed, only
a flesh wound, but was sufficiently painful, though
not dangerous in any way.</p>

<p>In obedience to his superior's command, the
young seaman took two paces to the front and
saluted, bringing his heels together with a smart
click, despite the pain his wound gave him as
he did so.</p>

<p>"Strong," went on the admiral, "you have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Mr. Varian and the United States Navy a great
service. Had it not been for your quick, intelligent
work, it might have been that the Pulsifers
and the others implicated in this dastardly affair
would have escaped. Mr. Varian might not have
been with us this morning. I congratulate and
thank you on behalf of the government and on
behalf of the naval department and officers of
this squadron."</p>

<p>Ned's lips moved. Somehow he couldn't speak.
Herc's face, bisected by a broad grin, thrust itself
forward among the officers till it appeared, like a
whimsical moon, between the elbows of Captain
Dunham and the rear-admiral.</p>

<p>"I shall see, Strong," went on the admiral,
"that some signal notice is taken of your clever,
plucky work. You are of the stuff of which real
seamen are made and we want to encourage men
like you in every way possible. And now, gentlemen,
as we are not within hearing of Washington&mdash;or
the papers&mdash;perhaps it might not be
inconsistent with the occasion to give three
cheers."</p>

<p>"Oh, those crazy Americanoes!" exclaimed the
little yellow-faced Cubans, as three long, resounding
naval cheers, with a zipping "tiger,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
rang through the stagnant tropic air and went
booming over the water as far as the grim sea
bulldogs of Uncle Sam, lying at anchor off the
town.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A HIT WITH CHAOSITE.</p>


<p>"General battle practice to-day," cried a bosn's
mate, as he hastened forward through the scrubbing
stations the next morning.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc exchanged glances above their
swabs.</p>

<p>At last they were to see what actual battle
conditions were like. The practice hitherto had
been merely target practice and mine-laying&mdash;the
latter being dummies, of course. To-day,
they had learned earlier, the ships were to be
"cleared for action" just as in actual service, and
steaming at eighteen knots, were to fire at the
targets as they steamed by as if they were repulsing
a hostile fleet. No wonder the jackies were
on the tiptoe of expectation.</p>

<p>As for the two chums, they were in high spirits.
Promotion loomed ahead of Ned, and Herc
wished him success with all the warmth of his
generous heart. Not a thought of envy entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
his mind. He was as delighted as Ned himself
over the big chance that had come to the Dreadnought
Boy.</p>

<p>Each of my readers can imagine for himself
what the two boys had had to say the evening
before, when they had been reunited; and Ned
had to tell his adventures over and over again,
till Herc advised him to invest in a phonograph
and talk his narrative into it for indefinite reiteration.
"Pills" had patched Ned's injured leg
so deftly that it hurt him hardly at all, and the
doctor's suggestion that he go on the "binnacle
list," otherwise the sick roll, had met with Ned's
unqualified disapproval.</p>

<p>"I'm fit for duty. I want to do it, sir, if possible,"
he had said quietly but firmly, when the
doctor suggested that he rest up for a few
days.</p>

<p>The doctor, a veteran of thirty years' service,
had thrown up his hands in amazement.</p>

<p>"I've been in the navy for more years than
you've seen, my boy, by a long shot," he exclaimed,
"and I never heard a seaman talk like
that before. Well, if you want to work, go
ahead, and my blessing go with you."</p>

<p>"I hope that young man is quite right in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
head," the man of medicine had muttered to himself,
as he heard the door of his sanctum closed
by the first bluejacket he had ever met who was
not anxious to avail himself of the restful idleness
afforded by being on the "binnacle list."</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast the <i>Manhattan</i>
was a scene of the liveliest activity.</p>

<p>Rails came down and were stowed. Boats
were lowered, ventilators shipped, war nets
rigged, and every object on the deck that was not
an absolute fixture vanished. The same thing
occurred on other vessels of the fleet, in obedience
to the flagship's signalled order:</p>

<p>"Clear for action."</p>

<p>It was like stripping human fighters for a ring
contest.</p>

<p>Bugles shrilly sang the order from ship to
ship of the squadron. While the smiling jackies
bustled about on deck, stewards and orderlies
below were stowing pictures and bric-a-brac between
mattresses and placing all the ship's crockery
and glassware in places where it was not in
danger of being jarred to fragments by the earthquake-like
detonations of the big guns.</p>

<p>In the meantime officers had invested themselves
in their full-dress uniforms with side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
arms, and an hour after the order had been first
transmitted the signal to "Up Anchor" fluttered
out from the halliards of the flagship.</p>

<p>Aboard the <i>Manhattan</i> especially excitement
ran at high tension, for Mr. Varian himself had
come aboard that morning in a shore boat, and
it was an open secret that the big twelve-inch
gun, fitted with his Chaosite breech&mdash;was to receive
its first sea test.</p>

<p>The first sight that greeted the eyes of Herc
and Ned, reporting for duty in their turret as the
squadron got under way beneath a pall of black
smoke, was the unveiling, so to speak, of the inventor's
masterpiece. Mr. Varian and Lieutenant
Timmons, the ship's gunnery officer in command
of the turret, had their heads together
over the intricate piece of machinery as the two
Dreadnought Boys entered the steel-walled box,
in which they were practically a part of the machinery.</p>

<p>The inventor greeted them with a kindly nod.
Perhaps the thought shot into his mind that had
it not been for the pluck and clear-headedness of
one of the Dreadnought Boys, he might not have
been there.</p>

<p>"Is there any news, sir?" Ned asked respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
as soon as he got a chance to speak to the
inventor.</p>

<p>"No. The launch that was sent to intercept
the Pulsifers' vessel has not yet reported, but
we may hear from her at any time now."</p>

<p>"Let us hope that the rascals haven't got a
start and boarded some passenger vessel at sea,"
put in Lieutenant Timmons.</p>

<p>As the officer joined in the conversation Ned
saluted and went to another part of the turret.
It is not naval usage for an enlisted man to converse
with an officer, and Ned was far too well-trained
a young man-o'-warsman to break any
rule, even the unwritten ones, which in the navy
are almost as numerous as the codified regulations.</p>

<p>The excitement under which all hands labored
was, however, far too keen to allow even the
thoughts of the Pulsifers' capture to interfere
with present duty.</p>

<p>Especially was this the case on two of the vessels
of the squadron&mdash;the <i>Idaho</i>, the holder of the
coveted meat-ball, and, as has been mentioned,
the <i>Manhattan</i>, every jackie on board of which
vessel longed with his whole soul to see the gunnery
flag flying from the Dreadnought's main.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>The scores stood even between the big guns of
the two battleships now, and the open secret that
the morning practice was to be made, in large
part, with the Varian gun and explosive made the
<i>Manhattan's</i> jackies fearful that they might lose,
after all.</p>

<p>Jim Cooper, nervous and high-strung as ever,
crouched in his seat beside the big weapon as the
charge was rammed home and the breech slapped
to on the heavy load of Chaosite, which the two
Dreadnought Boys beheld for the first time. It
was a pinkish, crystalline-looking substance, and
its inventor claimed, as safe to handle as ordinary
clay, which it resembled in its plasticity. Just to
show its properties, before the charge was placed,
the inventor picked up a chunk of the explosive
and compressed it in his hands. He moulded it
into several different shapes, and concluded the
exhibition by throwing it on the flooring of the
turret with force enough to have detonated a
charge of dynamite.</p>

<p>"There is only one danger I apprehend from
it," he had explained to Lieutenant Timmons,
"and that is in the event of a 'flareback.' But
under such conditions there is no powder made
that is safe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>In reply to the officer's questions, the inventor
explained that Chaosite was a slow-burning explosive,
and if the much-dreaded flareback ever
occurred in a gun in which it was being used,
blazing particles of the freed explosive would be
scattered about the turret. As Chaosite would
only explode when confined, these particles would
glow like hot coals till they burned out. The
deadly peril consisted in the fact that the doors
of the ammunition hoist opened directly into
the turret. There were safety shutters to the
hoist, but in action the reloading followed so
fast on the firing of the guns that there
was little chance of the safety devices being
used.</p>

<p>The shaft of the ammunition hoist led directly
down to the ammunition table below the water-line
on which the explosive was piled, ready to be
shot upward on electric elevators. Alongside the
ammunition tables were the open doors of the
ship's magazine. It does not require vivid imagination
to picture what would be the result of
blazing particles of a substance like Chaosite
dropping down the hoist onto the powder and explosives
piled below. Quick and utter annihilation
would follow. Not a soul of the eight hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
odd crew and forty officers would stand any
but the smallest chance of salvation.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys, as well as the rest of
the crew in the turret, were interested listeners
to the conversation. All of them knew what a
flareback was. One had occurred on the <i>Georgia</i>
a year before, costing two lives. It is usually
caused by fragments of burning powder being
left in the chamber of the gun after a charge has
been fired. An electric blower is attached to the
big guns of Uncle Sam's navy, which is supposed
to thoroughly clean the chamber after each discharge;
but it is not careless sailor-proof, and
occasionally the newspapers bear dreadful testimony
to the result of a flareback, which occurs
when the new load is ignited by the left-over
fragments of the old one.</p>

<p>But the talk between Mr. Varian and the officer
was suddenly checked.</p>

<p>"Boom!"</p>

<p>The flagship had fired, and, as the glass
brought to bear by Lieutenant Timmons showed,
had missed the first target.</p>

<p>At the distance of a mile and a half the targets,
with their tiny boats bobbing at a safe distance,
looked extremely small. Shooting at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
potato on a fence post at twenty rods with a small
rifle is easy compared to the task before Uncle
Sam's gunners.</p>

<p>"Now, Cooper, steady, my lad!"</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons' voice sounded strained
and harsh as the gun pointer squinted through
his telescope and depressed his pointing lever ever
so little. Already the range had been signaled
from the fire-control wells.</p>

<p>The <i>Manhattan</i> was quivering to the speed of
her engines, rushing her stripped form past the
targets at eighteen knots.</p>

<p>Every man of that gun crew was under as
painful a tension as the officer. As for the inventor,
his face took on a deadly pallor as he
leaned against the rear wall of the turret. In a
few moments now he would know if his invention
was a failure or a glorious success.</p>

<p>A tiny signal light&mdash;the message from the firing
room glowed.</p>

<p>Cooper looked round. His wrinkled face was
grotesquely knotted, like an ape's, in his excitement.
His hand shook, but there was a glitter in
his eyes that showed he meant to get that target.</p>

<p>"Brace yourselves, men!" warned the officer.</p>

<p>The boys stood as they had been taught, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
knees slightly bent, so as to be springy. As they
got the last order they stuffed cotton in their
ears. Otherwise, the drums would have been
shattered by the discharge.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir," breathed Cooper.</p>

<p>"Fire!"</p>

<p>There was a sharp click from the electric firing
switch and a tiny spurt of bluish flame.</p>

<p>A shock like that of an earthquake followed.
The mighty explosion seemed to rend the turret.</p>

<p>It had not died out before the glasses of the
gunnery officer, the inventor and the gun-pointer
were bearing on the distant target and the boats
scurrying toward it. From the bridge and the
quarter deck similar scrutiny was brought to bear.</p>

<p>Chaosite was almost smokeless, so their vision
was not obscured, as with the old-fashioned
powder&mdash;even the so-called "smokeless" making
quite a smother.</p>

<p>"Hit, sir!" shot out Cooper dryly, as the signal
man in the target boat wig-wagged the news.</p>

<p>"Now let the <i>Idaho</i> folks get busy!" cried the
delighted gun crew.</p>

<p>The new explosive and the new gun had proven
themselves one of the biggest naval successes of
many a day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE STUFF A JACKIE'S MADE OF.</p>


<p>Hastily the gunnery officer scribbled a note
and handed it to Herc.</p>

<p>"Here, my man, take this to Captain Dunham,"
he said, thrusting the paper into Herc's
hand.</p>

<p>The red-headed boy was off like a flash, and
a second later the captain, who had already witnessed
the signaling of the successful hit, was
reading the details of the wonderful results
achieved with the new gun.</p>

<p>He detained Herc several minutes while he
asked him numerous questions about the handling
of the gun, all of which the boy answered so
intelligently as to bring nods of approbation from
the group of officers surrounding the commander
of the <i>Manhattan</i> on the vessel's flying bridge.</p>

<p>By the time Herc started back for the turret,
the <i>Manhattan</i> was close upon the second target.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've got to hurry," thought the boy, quickening
his pace.</p>

<p>But before he had more than reached the midship
section of the Dreadnought another mighty
shock set her stout frame aquiver, and Herc knew
another shot had been fired.</p>

<p>"Another hit!" he heard a shout go up an instant
later. "We've got the <i>Idaho</i> folks lashed
to the mast. They missed the first target."</p>

<p>But even as the cry reverberated along the
decks there came another sound that struck terror
to the heart of the Dreadnought Boy.</p>

<p>It was a heavy, smothered explosion that
seemed to come from within the turret itself. At
the same instant great clouds of yellow-colored
smoke began to roll from the top ventilators.</p>

<p>"It's a flareback!" Herc heard old Tom shout.
"Heaven help the poor souls in there!"</p>

<p>A flareback!</p>

<p>What the words meant Herc knew only too
well. In the poisonous fumes of the burning
Chaosite, vomited backward from the big gun's
breech, there was quick, sure death.</p>

<p>Suddenly the small door in the barbette of the
turret opened, and four half-crazed, reeling men
staggered out, bearing a limp form of a fifth. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
was Jim Cooper, the gun-pointer, they carried.
Blackened and almost unrecognizable as the men
were, the look of blank horror on their faces
burned itself into Herc's mind.</p>

<p>"Where's the lieutenant and Mr. Varian?
Where's Ned Strong?" the jackies shouted, as
they crowded round the staggering men. The
survivors could only wave their limp arms back
toward the inferno from which they had emerged.</p>

<p>"B-b-blown to b-b-blazes!" gasped one in a
choked voice.</p>

<p>All at once, and before Captain Dunham and
the officers could reach the scene, a red-headed
figure ripped off its blouse, and, wrapping it
about its head, plunged on all fours into the small
door from which the smoke-blackened five had
emerged.</p>

<p>It was Herc Taylor.</p>

<p>"Stop that man!" shouted Captain Dunham,
as he arrived, just in time to see Herc vanish in
the smoke.</p>

<p>An ensign plunged forward. Half a dozen
bluejackets followed him.</p>

<p>"No, stop! Come back!" shouted the captain.
"Enough lives have been sacrificed."</p>

<p>Reluctantly the men came back. Tears rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
down the ensign's face as he begged to be allowed
to enter the turret. But the commander was
firm. No more lives would he have thrown away.
For that Herc was doomed to the same death as
it seemed sure had overtaken the officer, Mr.
Varian and Ned Strong, seemed a definite certainty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<a href="images/i5large.jpg"><img src="images/i5.jpg" width="397" height="600" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption">Captain Dunham himself caught Ned Strong as he fell.</div>
</div>

<p>"Signal the flagship of the accident, Mr.
Scott," ordered the captain, whose face was set
and white, but whose voice was steady as if he
were issuing a routine order.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir."</p>

<p>The executive officer issued the necessary
orders.</p>

<p>A second later the boom of the <i>Idaho's</i> gun
sounded.</p>

<p>Another miss.</p>

<p>"The <i>Manhattan</i> wins the meat ball!" shouted
some jackie far back in the throng of anxious-faced,
pallid men.</p>

<p>"Stow that, you lummox!" growled old Tom,
and his admonition was echoed angrily by a
dozen tars. It would have fared hard with that
jackie if they could have laid hands on him.</p>

<p>The minutes rolled by and still there came no
sign from within the turret.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>An ensign, despatched below by the captain,
had reported that not a single spark had dropped
down the hoist.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, that means that there was a hero
in that turret!" exclaimed the captain. "Before
death came he closed those doors and in all probability
saved the ship."</p>

<p>The others nodded. It was not a situation in
which words seemed appropriate.</p>

<p>From the turret ventilators little smoke was
now issuing. If any of the four men inside that
steel-walled trap remained alive, they stood a
fighting chance now.</p>

<p>Suddenly the jackies set up a roar.</p>

<p>From the turret door there staggered a black,
weird figure; its clothes hung in shreds and
blood streamed from a dozen cuts and bruises.
In its arms this reeling figure carried another
scarecrow-like form, the latter half-naked, like its
bearer.</p>

<p>The first figure turned toward the dumfounded
group of officers with a ghastly attempt at a
smile on its blackened face, and then pitched
forward with its burden.</p>

<p>Captain Dunham himself caught Ned Strong
as he fell. Mr. Scott, the executive officer, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
swift to act as his commander, had at the same
instant seized hold of the limp form of Lieutenant
Timmons, which the Dreadnought Boy had
dragged from the jaws of death.</p>

<p>The doctor, a strange, soft light on his face,
was still bending over his so strangely restored
patients, when another roar came from the
jackies. They seized each other and capered
about like lunatics, and not an officer checked
them. Temporarily the <i>Manhattan</i> housed a mob
of cheering, yelling maniacs.</p>

<p>For through the turret door there now emerged
a second figure, but this one bore a head of fiery
red above his sooty countenance.</p>

<p>It was Herc, and with him he dragged out
the collapsed figure of the inventor.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys had beaten the flareback
at its own grisly game.</p>

<p>From the scorched lips of Lieutenant Timmons,
who, besides a few burns and the effects of
the severe shock, had, like the others, miraculously
escaped injury, the captain that evening
heard the whole story.</p>

<p>The flareback had come like a bolt from the
blue while the gun crew, still cheering Jim Cooper's
second hit, were reloading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>The officer had felt himself blown back across
the turret and smashed against the steel wall.
The place was filled with acrid smoke and yelling,
terrified men. Through the smoke glowed the
blazing fragments of Chaosite that had been
spurted back out of the gun.</p>

<p>Dimly the officer had seen Ned Strong stagger
through the smoke toward the doors of the hoist,
which were open preparatory to receiving another
load. At the same time Lieutenant Timmons was
trying with all his might to reach the same goal.
He fell before he attained his object, however,
and the last thing he knew was that he saw Ned
seize the lever that swung the safety doors together
and then collapse in a heap.</p>

<p>The inventor had fared much as had the officer,
except that he succumbed to the fumes more
quickly. He had managed, however, to open
the ventilators to their full capacity by seizing,
with his last conscious movement, the control that
elevated them. This action undoubtedly contributed
in large measure to saving the lives of
those imprisoned in the death trap, for even Jim
Cooper recovered, and a court martial later acquitted
Lieutenant Timmons of all blame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The joy that ran through the fleet when it was
learned that not a single serious injury had resulted
from the accident on the <i>Manhattan</i> may
be imagined. Battle practice, which had stopped
for that day, was ordered resumed on the morrow.
But before that occurred another event
happened which marked the end of one of the
boldest attempts on record to steal one of Uncle
Sam's most jealously guarded secrets.</p>

<p>The squadron was at anchor that evening, and
retreat had just blown, when the wireless operator
of the Dreadnought sought Captain Dunham
with a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>It was a wireless from the launch sent after
the Pulsifers and their gang, and reported that
the yacht had been intercepted and boarded, off
Boco del Toros, and that all the miscreants were
captured.</p>

<p>The captain himself it was who sought out
Ned and Herc, in the sick bay, and communicated
the news to them. Both boys had been placed on
the "binnacle list" under their protests; but,
gritty as they were, they had been ordered to the
ship's hospital peremptorily.</p>

<p>The rest of the gun crew shared their retreat,
though each and every one of the rescued men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
declared that he was fit and able for duty. As
a matter of fact, however, all of them had had
a severe shock, and it was some days before they
finally recovered and were about again receiving
the congratulations of their shipmates.
In the meantime battle practice went on, and
the <i>Manhattan</i> eventually won the "meat-ball."</p>

<p>The boys received the news of the capture of
the Pulsifers with a cheer, feeble but sincere.
The summary court martial called to decide the
cases of Carl Schultz, Silas, and Hank Harkins
was convened the next day, when the crest-fallen
prisoners were brought back on board. Schultz
and Silas broke down under questioning and confessed
that they were escaped prisoners, and were
returned to the Illinois authorities to serve out
life sentences for the murder of an old farmer
near Springfield many years before.</p>

<p>Ralph Kennell was sentenced to serve ten years
in a government penitentiary and to be dishonorably
discharged from the service. Hank Harkins
escaped with a dishonorable discharge, on
the boys' intercession for him. As for the Pulsifers,
they were given over to the Federal authorities,
and are now serving long terms at the Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
prison in Atlanta, Georgia. Simultaneously
with the discovery of the plot, the Baron vanished
from Washington, leaving a disappointed
and mystified fiancée. It was never learned for
just what government the Pulsifers had been
engaged in their work of spying and bribing.</p>

<p>How Hank Harkins got mixed up with the
plotters he explained to the court martial. He
had fallen into Schultz's and Silas' company in
New York and gambled much of his money away
to them. Afraid to write home for more, he had
cast about for a way to recruit his finances, and
when Schultz and Silas suggested that he join
them in the work they had undertaken for the
Pulsifers, he willingly agreed.</p>

<p>A few days after Ned and Herc were once
more up and about&mdash;for they had been "binnacled"
while the above events transpired&mdash;they
were summoned aft to the captain's cabin, and
told that on the return of the fleet to American
waters they were to report to the Secretary of
the Navy at Washington without delay. This
event occurred in the early part of June.</p>

<p>The two lads, brown-faced and alert, but somewhat
alarmed at the prospect of encountering
such a mighty personage as the Secretary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
Navy, called at the department, according to
instructions, and sent in their names.</p>

<p>"Send them right in," came a hearty voice,
although there was a long row of visitors ahead
of the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>"And so you are the two lads that Captain
Dunham thinks more about than any bluejackets
in the service," began the secretary, a keen-faced,
slender man, with a bristly black mustache and
kindly, penetrating eyes. "These are the lads,"
he went on, turning to a portly man with a gray
mustache and a pleasant smile, who stood behind
him.</p>

<p>The stout man stepped forward, and as he
did so the boys were struck with an air of dignity
he bore about him, which was even more impressive
than that which hedged the secretary
about.</p>

<p>"My lads," he said, "I have heard with interest
and deep admiration of your bravery, and, better
than that, your cool-headedness when the accident
that imperilled every soul on the <i>Manhattan</i>
occurred. Had it not been for the pluck of one
of you, a disaster which would have been historic
in its horror might have occurred. I refer to
your action in closing the safety doors, Strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you, Taylor"&mdash;Herc turned as red as his
own thatch&mdash;"you are also deserving of the highest
praise. Your action in entering what seemed
a certain death trap was heroic in the extreme.
The United States Government is proud of you
both, and I am authorized to pin upon you, as
unfading mementoes of your conduct, these."</p>

<p>From two blue plush cases the portly man with
the kind smile drew two gold badges which he
pinned on the breast of each Dreadnought Boy.</p>

<p>They were the coveted medals of honor.</p>

<p>"I know that you will wear them with the highest
appreciation of their significance. I congratulate
you both."</p>

<p>The portly man turned to the secretary with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I think that is all, Mr. Secretary," he said.</p>

<p>"I believe so, Mr. President," said the secretary,
rising and opening the door.</p>

<p>The boys' eyes fairly popped in their heads.
Herc's amazement actually overcame his sense of
discipline.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, was that the President himself?" he
quavered, as the secretary returned to his desk.</p>

<p>"It was," smiled the secretary, "and he was
here at his own special wish. He ordered a detailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
report made of your actions to him and
investigated your case carefully. You young
men have been rarely and highly honored. And
now one thing remains to be done. You have
received the highest honor the navy can confer
for heroism displayed in line of duty. The government
has for actions like yours a more substantial
reward. I present you with these two
purses, each containing a hundred dollars in
gold."</p>

<p>The boys stammered their thanks somehow,
while the room seemed to whirl round them. How
they ever got out once more on to the sunlit
Pennsylvania Avenue they often discussed afterward,
but never arrived at any satisfactory conclusion.</p>

<p>"I guess we flew," Herc always says; "I know
I felt as if I was walking on air."</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys had a two weeks' furlough
before rejoining the fleet. They spent part
of this in New York, seeing the sights, not forgetting
a visit to the office where they had enlisted,
and a portion of it in the old village, where,
as may be imagined, they were the "heroes of the
hour." Old Zack still exhibits a dented Canadian
dime with which Ned presented him as a souvenir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
The village band, not to be behindhand,
learned to play a series of strange discords declared
by them to be the navy's own, particular
march, "Nancy Lee."</p>

<p>And so, with their hearts overflowing with
patriotism, and a fixed determination ever to
serve the flag and their country with an unflagging
devotion, we will for the present take our
leave of the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>But many adventures, stranger and more
fraught with peril than any through which they
had yet passed, were ahead of them. A career in
the navy is, even in "the piping times of peace,"
one full of excitement and action, and in their
immediate future the boys were to realize this.</p>

<p>Life on board a torpedo-boat destroyer is a
strange one in many ways, and the boys, in their
coming experience on such a craft were destined
to have this borne in on them. Their adventures
on one of Uncle Sam's sea-tigers in a
strange country and among strange people will
be related in full in the next volume of this series,

<p class="center medium"><b>The Dreadnought Boys on Battle Practice.</b></p>

<p>How many times have you paused to gaze provided
you live in a maritime town of course, at Uncle Sam's
grim, gray sea-fighters swinging at their anchors, or
steaming majestically by? Haven't you thought then that
you would like to know something of the lives of the
servers of their country who pass the best part of their
adventurous lives within those steel walls?</p>

<p>There are no books published which will tell you
more of the new navy,&mdash;of the men, the ships, the huge
guns, the submarine auxiliaries and all the hundred and
one things that go to make up the fascination of the
naval seaman's life, than these volumes.</p>

<p>In the first volume of the series which bears the
above title Ned Strong and Herc Taylor make their debut
in Uncle Sam's navy. Of course they have to endure
much rough joking. Ned, however, proves so handy with
his fists in a notable set-to with the ship's bully that
the boys soon set themselves on a footing. From that
moment on adventures come thick and fast. At target
practice Herc-by a mean trick of his enemy becomes a
living target for a twelve inch gun. A flare-back in the
forward turret of the Dreadnought on which they are
serving gives the lads their longed-for opportunity to
show the stuff they are made of. Real books for real boys.</p>

<p class="center medium"><b>THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS ABOARD A DESTROYER.</b></p>

<p>The adventures of two young men of wars-men
on board one of the wickedest types of
sea-fighters,&mdash;the speedy, deadly, torpedo-boat
destroyer. On board one of these sea-tigers the
Dreadnought Boys voyage to a turbulent
South American republic, in the internal troubles
of which our country has, on account of
her citizens' interests, a duty of protection and
supervision to perform.</p>

<p>The part the boys played in the revolution
which threatened to bankrupt several American
interests, and how they saved the day
for the government by clever means and clear
grit, is well told. At one stage of their adventures,
the boys handle a South American destroyer
with such cleverness and seamanship
that they avert disastrous consequences to our
flag and interests. Like its predecessor this book
possesses the tang of the sea. Its action also
takes place against the shifting, kaleidoscopic
background of the revolution.</p>

<p>The excitement of warfare on sea and land,
the thrill of sustained interest in the lads'
scrapes and difficulties is on every page. Best
of all, the volume shows the part that our navy
takes shaping world politics; how it does big
things without fuss or fireworks. Emphatically
a book for every lad who has felt the call of
the sea or the thrill of good fighting and adventure
in tropic climes.</p>

<p>A fascinating narrative of the doings of some
bright boys who become part of the great Boy
Scout movement. The first of a series dealing
with this organization, which has caught on like
wild fire among healthy boys of all ages and in
all parts of the country.</p>

<p>While in no sense a text-book, the volume
deals, amid its exciting adventures, with the
practical side of Scouting. To Rob Blake and
his companions in the Eagle Patrol, surprising,
and sometimes perilous things happen constantly.
But the lads, who are, after all, typical
of most young Americans of their type, are
resourceful enough to overcome every one of
their dangers and difficulties.</p>

<p>How they discover the whereabouts of little
Joe, the "kid" of the patrol, by means of smoke

how they assist the passengers of a stranded
steamer and foil a plot to harm and perhaps
kill an aged sea-captain, one must read the book

<p>Connected with the dwellings of the vanished

so fit to solve it as a band of adventurous Boy
Scouts? The solving of the secret and the routing
of a bold band of cattle thieves involved Rob
Blake and his chums, including "Tubby" Hopkins,
in grave difficulties.</p>

<p>There are few boys who have not read of
the weird snake dance and other tribal rites of

vanishing Indians are explained in interesting
detail. Few boys' books hold more thrilling
chapters than those concerning Rob's captivity
among the Moquis.</p>

<p>Through the fascinating pages of the narrative
also stalks, like a grim figure of impending
tragedy, the shaggy form of Silver Tip, the giant
grizzly. In modern juvenile writing, there is
little to be found as gripping as the scene in
which Rob and Silver Tip meet face to face.
The boy is weaponless and,&mdash;but it would not

trip takes them to the dim and mysterious land
of Lower California.</p>

<p>Naturally, as one would judge from the title,

<p>In this book also, the young motor rangers
solve the mystery of the haunted Mexican cabin,
and exterminate for all time a strange terror

<p>The Motor Rangers too, have an exciting
encounter with Mexican cowboys, which beginning

the clean, healthy, yet fascinating, nature of the stories

<p>This is a brisk, vigorous, snappy,
story in which winter sports&mdash;snowshoeing,
skating, rabbit
hunting, and such&mdash;are features. In
the tale Rodney Grant, a young
Texas cowboy, appears at Oakdale
and attends the academy, being adjudged
an imposter by the New
England lads, who entertain a mistaken
notion that all Texans swagger
and bluster and talk in the vernacular.
As Grant is quiet and gentlemanly
in his bearing and will not,
for some mysterious reason, take
part in certain violent sports, they
erroneously imagine him to be a
coward; but eventually, through the
demands of necessity and force of
circumstances, the fellow from Texas
is led to prove himself, which he
does in a most effective manner, becoming,
for the time being, at least,
the hero of the village. This is a
story of vigorous, healthy boys and
their likes and dislikes; it is brimming
over with human nature and,
while true to real life, is as fascinating
as the most imaginative yarn of
adventure.</p>
